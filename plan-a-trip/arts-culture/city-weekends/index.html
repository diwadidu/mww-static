The thing is, you have to bring your own theme. I have one every time I go there: Blues and bicycling.  Museums and dim sum. Skyscrapers and food tours. That's because the possibilities are endless. There's so much to do in Chicago that it's easy to bounce around like a kid in a candy store, overwhelmed by choices, as time runs out.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/best-chicago-trip-planning/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/christmas-in-milwaukee/">Christmas in Milwaukee: Holiday lights, theater and German food</a></h2><p>No one ever accused Milwaukee of being flashy. Best known for tractors, motorcycles and beer, it’s a meat-and-potatoes kind of town, stolid and practical like the Germans who built it. It’s not what you’d call a trendy destination. And yet every time I go there, I have a great time.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/christmas-in-milwaukee/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/ethnic-chicago/">Touring Chicago&#39;s ethnic neighborhoods</a></h2><p>everything about Chicago is ethnic.  Chicago is a mosaic, a city of neighborhoods settled by waves of immigrants who arrived to dig its waterways, build its railroads and work in its slaughterhouses.  One of its first neighborhoods was Bridgeport, settled by Irish canal workers in the 1840s and the stronghold of Mayor Richard J. Daley and his son Richard M. Daley, the current mayor.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/ethnic-chicago/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/minneapolis-riverfront/">Best things to do and see on the riverfront in Minneapolis</a></h2><p>The Falls of St. Anthony wasn't a very tall waterfall.

Liquor brought the first white resident to Minnesota's capital; he was Pierre Parrant, a swinish, one-eyed former voyageur named Pig's Eye. He set up his first tavern near Fort Snelling, but was rousted in 1837 by officers who were tired of the trouble it caused.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/st-paul-sightseeing/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/summer-milwaukee/">Best festivals and fun things to do along Milwaukee&#39;s lakefront</a></h2><p>Once, I thought of Milwaukee as the ugly duckling of Midwest cities, a colorless runt with the grit of Chicago but none of its allure.
