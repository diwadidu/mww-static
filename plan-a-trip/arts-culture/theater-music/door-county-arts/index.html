<h2>On this Wisconsin peninsula, vacation isn't complete without a dose of culture.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="https://images.midwestweekends.com//media/images/a/m/american_folklore_theatre.jpg" alt="Northern Sky Theater in Door County." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Once, evening entertainment in Door County consisted of watching the sun
set over Green Bay.</p>
<p>Then, at the turn of the century, the seven sons of the Eagle Bluff
lighthouse keepers formed a band to entertain at various gatherings,
arriving with a horse-drawn piano.</p>
<p>The arts scene really got going in 1935, when the first theater was
founded on the lawn of a Fish Creek motel. The same year, a Danish
landscape architect from Chicago started the first arts school. In 1953,
the first music festival was founded.</p>
<p>Today, no vacationer has to sacrifice big-city standards in this
semi-rural area. National headliners play Fish Creek. Actors from
Chicago and New York perform on the shores of Green Bay. Composers
premiere concertos commissioned by the Peninsula Music Festival.</p>
<p>Even free concerts attract well-known performers.</p>
<p>In Door County, culture is a normal part of vacation. On one August
trip, I saw plays both at Northern Sky Theater and the Peninsula
Players.</p>
<p>The Players were founded when a theater-loving couple from Chicago put
on Noel Coward's &quot;Hay Fever&quot; and four other plays in the back yard
of the Bonnie Brook Motel.</p>
<p>In 1937, they acquired a 22-acre boys' camp on the shores of Green Bay,
and over the years, they were able to attract high-quality ensembles
that included actors Sam Wanamaker, Harvey Korman and Ralph Waite.</p>
<p>Today, Peninsula Players is the nation's oldest professional resident
summer theater.</p>
<p>Its grounds, strung with colored lights, looks like a set for &quot;A
Midsummer Night's Dream.&quot; Beyond its fringes, shadowy figures flit
through a fragrant cedar forest; ticket-holders come early to walk to
the pebble beach, sip glasses of wine and watch the sun set.</p>
<p>But back under the roof of the open-sided pavilion, the tone changes.
The Peninsula Players specialty is light comedy, and the play I saw was
a nonstop pratfall with cross-dressing doctors, mistaken identities and
the usual web of lies. The audience loved it.</p>
<p>After the play, the cast returned for a &quot;talk back&quot; session with the
audience, who asked about the exhausting pace, the actor's life and how
the company picks its plays. After Saturday-night performances, the
audience gathers with the cast and crew around a bonfire in the
waterfront Beer Garden.</p>

On its campus near Egg Harbor, Birch Creek offers five weeks of concerts
in summer.

<p>Another night, I drove to Peninsula State Park, a lovely expanse of
forest and beach between the villages of Fish Creek and Ephraim. In an
amphitheater ringed with tall red pines, the Northern Sky Theater troupe
performed one of its original musical comedies, &quot;Fishing for the
Moon.&quot;</p>
<p>Set in Wisconsin after the Civil War, it features a belle who pines for
a presumed-dead beau, a colonel who addresses his cows as troops, and
the Georgia man who arrives to &quot;shoot&quot; the colonel.</p>
<p>The scenario sounds as goofy as those of the troupe's other beloved
standards --- &quot;Lumberjacks in Love,&quot; &quot;Guys on Ice,&quot; &quot;Muskie
Love&quot; --- but the play actually was sweet, funny and full of good
music.</p>
<p>Performances of the troupe, which spun out of the University of
Wisconsin-Green Bay's Heritage Ensemble, are a popular bonus for the
park's campers.</p>
<p>Why are the arts so successful in Door County? It could be because
artists are like anyone else --- they like to spend part of their summer
in a lovely place.</p>
<p>The musicians who perform at the Peninsula Music Festival, says longtime
director Sharon Grutzmacher, don't need to be coaxed to show up.</p>
<p>&quot;They love to come here,&quot; she says. &quot;They can make music in a
beautiful setting, for an extremely receptive audience. So why wouldn't
they?&quot;</p>
