<p>In vacation hubs all across the region, summer theaters are launching
another season of delicious escapism.</p>
<p>With corps of enthusiastic young actors drawn from all over the nation,
they'll put on Neil Simon, Shakespeare, Agatha Christie and the bouncy
musicals vacationers love --- &quot;Little Shop of Horrors,&quot; &quot;Fiddler on
the Roof,&quot; &quot;Spamalot.&quot;</p>
<p>Light-hearted plays for light-hearted days --- it's a formula that
works.</p>
<p>Here's the schedule for <em>2021.</em></p>
<p>Most summer theaters use a mix of students and professional actors from
the Twin Cities or Chicago, who enjoy a bit of moonlighting in resort
towns.</p>
<p>Bemidji's Paul Bunyan Playhouse started when an entrepreneur brought a
troupe of New York actors to the northern Minnesota town in 1951.</p>
<p>He set up a theater at a resort on the shore of Lake Bemidji and started
a glorious season of summer stock. Four weeks later, he was broke, and
the actors were stranded.</p>
<p>But Bemidji's citizens had become hooked on theater. They raised enough
money to pay the actors' room and board while they performed the rest
of the season's plays, and enough to pay for their tickets home. Then
the town raised enough to pay for a season the next year, and the year
after that.</p>
<p>Now, the Paul Bunyan Playhouse is Minnesota's oldest professional
summer-stock company.</p>
<p>On the shores of Lake L'Homme Dieu in Alexandria, Minn., Theatre
L'Homme Dieu was started in 1961 at an old resort, a collaboration
between Alexandria and St. Cloud State University.</p>
<p>In the lakes region of northwest Iowa, Okoboji Summer Theater began in
an old airplane hangar in 1953, then was bought and expanded by Stephens
College of Columbia, Mo.</p>
<p>All summer theaters are in areas with lots of tourists, who come to see
a play after a day of sunning or sightseeing.</p>
<p>Spring Green, Wis., is home not only to the classical American Players
Theater, whose professional troupe comes mainly from Chicago, but to
kitschy House on the Rock.</p>

<p>In Wisconsin's Door County, American Folklore Theatre puts on original
musical comedies in an amphitheater ringed by tall red pines in
Peninsula State Park.</p>
<p>The Peninsula Players are nearby, in Fish Creek. The troupe put on its
first plays in 1935 in the back yard of a Fish Creek motel and is the
nation's oldest professional resident summer theater.</p>
<p>Now, it performs on the site of an old boys' camp on the shores of
Green Bay, in an open-sided pavilion on the edge of a twinkle-lit cedar
forest. Ticket-holders like to stroll there before the play, sipping
glasses of wine.</p>

American Players Theater in Spring Green perform in the open air;
American Players Theater also has an indoor theater.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://americanplayers.org/">American Players Theater</a> , Spring
