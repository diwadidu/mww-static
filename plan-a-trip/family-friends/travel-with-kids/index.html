Anything would fire it up, especially tales of exploration: in dank, twisting caves; along rushing creeks shadowed by stone bluffs; on sun-kissed hilltops, with the world stretching out all around. And I loved the tales told by two real-life children’s-book heroines: the resourceful tomboy Caddie Woodlawn, who roamed the wilderness of western Wisconsin during the Civil War, and Laura Ingalls Wilder, who relished life in the Big Woods above Lake Pepin before they became farmland. Western Wisconsin, it seems, has fired many young imaginations. One September, I took my own two children there, on a 185-mile tour with six spots that appeal particularly to kids.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/western-wisconsin-kids/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/zip-lines-midwest/">A zeal for zip lines</a></h2><p>It's a big rush, zipping over treetops.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/zip-lines-midwest/">Read story and trip tips</a></li></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="footer-links"><ul><li><a href="/plan-a-trip/">Plan A Trip</a></li><li><a href="/about/">Meet Us</a></li><li><a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="/events-policy/">Events Policy</a></li><!--li: a(href="/apps/contact.html") Contact us--><li><a href="/advertising/">Advertising</a></li></ul><p>&copy; Beth Gauper, 2007 - 2022 all rights reserved</p></div></div></div><div class="site-msg-container" id="web-compoment-msg"><div class="msg-outline"><p>Your browser does not support our events calendar page.

Gift Shop . . . Moccasins,’’  read my daughter Madeleine. &quot;And look — Candy Store.’’ &quot;This is a cute town,’’ said my son Peter, noticing the covered sidewalks. &quot;It’s like a cowboy town.’’</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/nisswa-turtle-races/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/travel-with-pets/">Traveling with a pet</a></h2><p>Planning a vacation with a dog can be frustrating. And yet,  pets have gone up in the world. Many craft breweries offer dog-friendly patios. And more lake resorts are setting aside cabins for families with pets, perhaps inspired by Martha, the talking dog in the popular children's book series, and her pointed reproach: &quot;We're your best friends — or have you forgotten?'' Some towns have started festivals just for dogs (and their owners).</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/travel-with-pets/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/zip-lines-midwest/">A zeal for zip lines</a></h2><p>It's a big rush, zipping over treetops.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/zip-lines-midwest/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/western-wisconsin-kids/">In Caddie and Laura's back yard</a></h2><p>When I was a child, I had a wild imagination. Anything would fire it up, especially tales of exploration: in dank, twisting caves; along rushing creeks shadowed by stone bluffs; on sun-kissed hilltops, with the world stretching out all around. And I loved the tales told by two real-life children’s-book heroines: the resourceful tomboy Caddie Woodlawn, who roamed the wilderness of western Wisconsin during the Civil War, and Laura Ingalls Wilder, who relished life in the Big Woods above Lake Pepin before they became farmland. Western Wisconsin, it seems, has fired many young imaginations. One September, I took my own two children there, on a 185-mile tour with six spots that appeal particularly to kids.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/western-wisconsin-kids/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/turtle-races-minnesota/">Critter races</a></h2><p>In June, racing season moves into full throttle in resort towns around Minnesota.

Milwaukee, sometimes called the biggest small town in America, doesn’t brag — though it should. It has a swell baseball stadium, a beloved art museum and a beautiful lakefront. Gemütlichkeit, the German term for congeniality and good life.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/milwaukee-kids/">Read story and trip tips</a></li></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="footer-links"><ul><li><a href="/plan-a-trip/">Plan A Trip</a></li><li><a href="/about/">Meet Us</a></li><li><a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="/events-policy/">Events Policy</a></li><!--li: a(href="/apps/contact.html") Contact us--><li><a href="/advertising/">Advertising</a></li></ul><p>&copy; Beth Gauper, 2007 - 2022 all rights reserved</p></div></div></div><div class="site-msg-container" id="web-compoment-msg"><div class="msg-outline"><p>Your browser does not support our events calendar page.
