The most famous battles that followed — Bull Run, Antietam, Gettysburg, Shiloh — were in the East.  But after Virginia and Tennessee, the most fought-over state was Missouri, which suffered 45 percent of all casualties.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/civil-war-battle-renactments-missouri/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/dakota-war-1862-minnesota/">Mourning the summer of 1862</a></h2><p>In 1858, as Europe creaked under the weight of its impoverished masses, Minnesota was a place of opportunity. It had plenty of land, and newcomers who worked hard could gain social standing as well as property, an impossibility in the old country. So the poor surged in, thankful for a future. &quot;When I consider my children, I think their futures will be very good, yes, much better than if I had stayed in Norway,'' my great-great-grandfather Rolf wrote home after his arrival in 1862.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/dakota-war-1862-minnesota/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/civil-war-battle-renactments-norskedalen/">Civil War, up close</a></h2><p>It was a gorgeous fall day in southwest Wisconsin, and all we could see was heartache and misery. &quot;Welcome to Virginia 1862,&quot; read the sign at the gates of Norskedalen, where pioneer homesteads evoke the Civil War era. Pushing open the door of a chinked-timber farmhouse, we encountered Nedda Blodgett, who was surprised to find strangers in her parlor but quickly welcomed us in a Southern drawl.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/civil-war-battle-renactments-norskedalen/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/grand-rapids-minnesota/">Lumberjacks and legends</a></h2><p>Loggers came first, and that era is re-created on the edge of town, on the wooded grounds of Forest History Center. On a summer day there, it may feel 80 degrees and sunny, but really it's a freezing day in December 1900. Miss Minnie the &quot;cookee,'' or cook's assistant, is showing us around the logging camp under the baleful glare of her boss, Miss Rebecca. We walk by a giant rut cutter, used to make grooves in the ice roads for the logging sleighs.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/grand-rapids-minnesota/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/history-day-camps-children-families/">Living like a pioneer</a></h2><p>It's the 21st century, but children still want to spend a day in Laura's world on the frontier — or Huck's world on the Mississippi, or Davy's in the woods. Laura and Huck didn't have iPods or Xboxes, but they had adventure. In their worlds, people had to live by their wits, unaided by technology, and make what they needed with their own hands. It's so romantic — and we're not talking Bella and Edward. If only these kids could go back in time to see what it was like . . . and as it turns out, they can.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/history-day-camps-children-families/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/civil-war-battle-reenactments/">Still fighting the Civil War</a></h2><p>You can find out at the annual encampments hosted by historic sites, where reenactors offer artillery drills, medical

Unnaturally still. Fifteen Union Army infantry units were camped around wagons in a meadow, near artillery and cavalry. Along a split-rail fence, a drum-and-fife corps pounded drums and blew trumpets. Gunners began to load their muskets. The cavalry got on pawing horses. Then a Union skirmish line marched down the meadow, followed by a tight column of infantrymen.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/civil-war-wade-house/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/madelia-jesse-james/">Posse on the prairie</a></h2><p>In September 1876, a vicious gang of outlaws came up against some ordinary Minnesotans. The outlaws came out on the short end. Twice. The Civil War ended more than a decade before the James-Younger Gang rode into Minnesota. But it was far from over in Missouri, devastated by guerrilla warfare and still simmering with resentment.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/madelia-jesse-james/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/mackinaw-city-colonial-michilimackinac/">Destination: Mackinaw City</a></h2><p>At the top of the Michigan mitten, a little village has seen a lot of action over the centuries.

They were swampers, sawyers and skidders. They were deckers, chainers, undercutters and riverhogs. They were dwarfed by the colossal trees they had to wrestle out of the forest, and their lives hung on their own brawn, nerve and dumb luck. Six days a week they worked, dawn to dusk, all winter long. In spring, they'd roar into Hayward for whiskey and wild women; their brawling earned the town a reputation reflected in a train conductor's call: &quot;All aboard for Hayward, Hurley and Hell!''</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/lumberjacks-hayward/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/fur-trade/">Scenes from the fur trade</a></h2><p>Long before settlers plodded into the Upper Midwest, its rivers and forests were swarming with a more footloose kind of entrepreneur. The Pilgrims still were getting a toehold on the eastern seaboard when Frenchman Jean Nicolet passed through the Straits of Mackinac in 1634 on his way to Green Bay, returning to Montreal with news of a vast interior filled with fur-bearing animals. Traders wasted no time going after the pelts, and international commerce already was brisk by the time people in Salem, Mass., were whipping themselves into a frenzy over imagined witchcraft.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/fur-trade/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/northfield-minnesota/">Feisty Northfield</a></h2><p>Northfield always has been shaped by newcomers.  First the Yankees came to town, then the Norwegians. Each started a college, and the Yankees built mills, whose flour won international prizes as the Minneapolis mill were just getting started. Missourians arrived in 1876 for a brief but memorable visit; the violent bank raid by the James-Younger Gang is called &quot;the seven minutes that shook Northfield.''</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/northfield-minnesota/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/sod-house/">Little sod house on the prairie</a></h2><p>Sometimes, it comes as a shock to tourists, especially those who grew up watching the TV show &quot;Little House on the Prairie,'' that life on the frontier wasn't all that fun. Twenty miles east of Walnut Grove, the late Stan McCone always told it as it was. A farmer, he'd heard stories about the early sod houses. None remained, so he decided to build one of his own, using an old sod cutter. &quot;There were 13 sod houses in this neighborhood, and those are just the ones we know about,'' he said. &quot;But with all those, there's zero recollection of them, and I know why — because of all the buried children alongside them. They had such hardship.''</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/sod-house/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/tall-ships-festivals/">Following the tall ships</a></h2><p>On the Great Lakes, everyone loves to see a multi-masted schooner, white sails flapping in the breeze.  On Lake Michigan, these magnificent replicas of 19th-century schooners and sloops are more common, offering tours and day sails from their homes when they're not appearing at festivals.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/tall-ships-festivals/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/war-1812-michigan-wisconsin-ontario-illinois/">War of 1812</a></h2><p>For its bicentennial in 2012, we heard about the War of 1812. war about, anyway?

But the iron made them rich, too. In 1865, reports of gold brought a rush of prospectors to the shores of Lake Vermilion. What they found, instead, was red earth.  Those who didn't go home disappointed stayed to develop one of the world's richest deposits of iron ore into an industry that would give rise to dozens of towns, help the nation win two world wars and create a distinctive piece of Minnesota's cultural fabric.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/iron-range-attractions/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/zebulon-pike/">Pike on the prowl</a></h2><p>In 1805, while Lewis and Clark were making history on the Missouri River, another explorer was heading up the Mississippi.
