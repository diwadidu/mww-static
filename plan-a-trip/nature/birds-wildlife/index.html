The rest of us come out to watch the birders, because they see things the rest of us don't.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/best-fall-bird-watching-spots/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/bird-hikes-midwest/">Birding with the pros</a></h2><p>In April, birds return to the woods. They're easy to hear, but not to see. Unlike spring wildflowers, birds don't stay put.  A flash of yellow likely is a warbler, but which kind — chestnut-sided, Blackburnian, magnolia, Wilson's? And those tweets, twitters and trills —  who's making them?</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/bird-hikes-midwest/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/birding-tiffany-wildlife-area/">Birding by rail</a></h2><p>If you don’t know a birder, you might think they have a severe case of attention-deficit disorder. They tend to stare off into space. They often stop talking mid-sentence. It’s hard to finish  conversations with them.  But their enthusiasm for nature is contagious. And in spring, birders know all the best places to go.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/birding-tiffany-wildlife-area/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/birds-horicon-marsh-wisconsin/">Life on Horicon Marsh</a></h2><p>On a spring morning in east-central Wisconsin, two geese suddenly shattered the stillness, honking urgently. Yellow warblers zoomed down from trees and out of sight. Redwing blackbirds clung to cattails, swaying in the stiffening wind. It was only 6:30 a.m., but it was rush hour on the Horicon Marsh. A human here feels oddly out of place, a lumbering interloper on a fast-moving avian freeway. Birds own this marsh, and they aren't shy about saying so, rending the air with trills and tweets as they go about their business.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/birds-horicon-marsh-wisconsin/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/bison-herds-midwest/">Eyeballing bison</a></h2><p>Like bald eagles, bison have staged a spectacular comeback. Now, the massive creatures that once roamed the plains by the millions has joined the national bird as the national mammal. Herds have grown, including the genetically pure herd at Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota, and have shared bison with parks and preserves in Minnesota, Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/bison-herds-midwest/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/crane-foundation-wisconsin/">Cranes of Wisconsin</a></h2><p>In Wisconsin, the rarest birds in the world live not far from the Dells. Not just any birds, but cranes — the tall, elegant birds of art and myth. In ancient Japan, cranes could grant wishes. In India, they're omens of good fortune.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/crane-foundation-wisconsin/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/eagle-bear-cams/">Wildlife reality show</a></h2><p>In the northeast Iowa town of Decorah, two pairs of nesting bald eagles have become an international phenomenon. Not only do they have a constant stream of live video, but avid watchers are snatching the best episodes — capturing the many dramas that go on in and around the nest — and posting them on Youtube for everyone to enjoy.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/eagle-bear-cams/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/eagle-watching-mississippi-river/">Where eagles land</a></h2><p>Eagles don't really have lovable personalities. But, man, are they fun to watch.
  Everything about them is larger than life, right down to their nests, which are so big and sturdy that bears sometimes climb into them to hibernate.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/eagle-watching-mississippi-river/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/eagles-wabasha/">All eyes on Wabasha</a></h2><p>Eagles reappeared slowly after DDT was banned in 1972, and one of the first places they could be seen was in this Minnesota town, just downriver from the mouth of the Chippewa River, which kept water open in winter so eagles could fish. The city built a deck downtown and staffed it with spotting scopes and volunteers from November through March.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/eagles-wabasha/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/ely-bear-center/">Ely and the three bears</a></h2><p>Everyone loves a teddy bear, especially one called Ted. He's one of the world's largest black bears, at 850 pounds, but he doesn't throw his weight around. When a fellow bear doesn't want to play, he merely whines, &quot;like a foghorn,'' says curator Donna Phelan. And when he wants to make friends, which is all the time, he makes a &quot;wonderful amiable sound, an umph-umph-umph.''</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/ely-bear-center/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/hawk-watching-duluth/">Hawk heaven</a></h2><p>On Duluth's Hawk Ridge, a bird in the hand is worth at least two in the sky. They're impressive when spotted overhead. But up close, it's easier to get to know a bird — say, the northern goshawk, a fierce predator whose image once adorned the helmet of Attila the Hun. As she held a young goshawk by the legs, naturalist Willow Maser struggled to make herself heard above its high-pitched screeches.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/hawk-watching-duluth/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/mississippi-winter/">Open sesame on the sloughs</a></h2><p>For people who love nature, winter is a time of opportunity. When it's cold enough, you can walk onto the Mississippi River. You can see bald eagles up close. You can explore sloughs and backwaters without being eaten alive by insects. &quot;Most of these places, you'd almost die in a few minutes in summer,&quot; says Scott Mehus, education specialist at the National Eagle Center in Wabasha. &quot;So now is a good time to get out there and see things.&quot;</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/mississippi-winter/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/orr-bear-sanctuary-minnesota/">Beguiled by bears</a></h2><p>Half a century ago, a Minnesota logger who lived in a forest full of hungry bears decided that if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. By the time he died at age 86, Vince Shute had fed generations of black bears, become best friends with a bear named Brownie and inspired bear-lovers all over the world. Shute wasn't a sophisticated man, but he had a heart.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/orr-bear-sanctuary-minnesota/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/owl-fest-houston/">Owl aboard</a></h2><p>Like most women who take care of small creatures, Karla Bloem splits her life into two parts: Before Alice and After Alice. Before Alice, Bloem could sleep late and travel whenever she felt like it. But then little Alice came along. Alice wakes her up at the crack of dawn, sulks if she leaves her and leaves messes all over the house. Alice is a spoiled brat, Karla Bloem admits.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/owl-fest-houston/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/owl-hunting-northern-minnesota/">Owls, owls, everywhere</a></h2><p>In the north woods, irruptions of owls make birders ecstatic. When food is scarce in far-north forests, owls fly south to look for it, many along the shores of Lake Superior. I don't have the patience to watch birds.  But when they come right to me . . . who can resist?</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/owl-hunting-northern-minnesota/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/prairie-chicken-festival/">Playing the field in Wisconsin</a></h2><p>It's a cold dawn on a Wisconsin marsh, but to a bunch of prairie chickens, it's a hot Saturday night on the town. They've come to see and be seen, and hormones are in charge. It's serious business, perpetuating a dwindling species.  But to humans watching from a blind, it's high comedy. Whenever a girl chicken is nearby, the boys inflate neon-orange sacs under their throats, drum their feet and start scurrying around like, well, chickens with their heads cut off.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/prairie-chicken-festival/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/spring-birding-festivals/">Spring bird festivals</a></h2><p>&quot;The
