<h2>A wintering flock of trumpeter swans has put Monticello on the map.</h2>

<p>It's winter in Monticello, and the livin' is easy.</p>
<p>For trumpeter swans, the largest water bird in North America, the
Mississippi River town is a virtual Club Med, thanks to balmy waters
from the nuclear power-generating plant upstream and a daily
all-you-can-eat spread of dried corn.</p>
<p>The first swans showed up in the winter of 1986, as the late Sheila
Lawrence was feeding the ducks and geese in the yard of her riverside
home. They appreciated her hospitality, and every year more came, first
by the dozens, then by the hundreds.</p>
<p>Now, as many as 2,000 trumpeter swans winter around Monticello, the
highest concentration east of the Rocky Mountains. Typically, half of
them belly up to the buffet at the Lawrence house each morning,
consuming 1,600 to 2,000 pounds of corn, with a little help from ducks
and geese.</p>
<p>It's quite a sight. In the morning, the big birds begin to congregate
on the water in front of her house, feet skimming the water as they
glide to a landing on outspread wings of 7 to 8 feet.</p>
<p>Sticking close to kin, they soon turn the shoreline into a raucous
playground, blustering, showing off and squabbling over insults, real or
imagined.</p>
<p>The noise is the first thing everyone notices. From the street, it's a
buzz, like a nest of angry hornets; from the river's edge, it's
cacophony, a high-pitched tumult of honks, squawks and screeches.</p>
<p>Onlookers also have increased by the hundreds, sometimes clogging the
narrow, dead-end residential street with cars and even tour buses.</p>
<p>The tiny &quot;park&quot; next to the Lawrence house, where people can watch the
swans from behind a rail fence, actually is a storm-sewer easement, and
there's never been space for parking.</p>
<p>The city considered moving the swans to a real city park on the other
end of town but it turned out Mississippi Drive is the perfect place for
wintering swans.</p>
<p>There's a shallow shelf on which swans can rest, the current is slow
and there's no boat or people traffic --- although trumpeter swans are
aggressive with each other, they're very skittish around humans.</p>

on the Mississippi.

<p>In Monticello, the swans tolerate only Jim Lawrence, who took over for
Sheila when she became ill in 2010. He moves among the swans  with slow,
measured steps, filling tubs and throwing out corn.</p>
<p>Sometimes, photographers ask if they can get even closer, but he always
say no.</p>
<p>&quot;The swans are right here, just in front of them,&quot; said Sheila
Lawrence before her death in April 2011. &quot;There's no other place you
can see something like this around here.&quot;</p>
<h3>A good show</h3>
<p>Every morning, Jim Lawrence starts up the auger that moves corn through
a pipe, from the gravity wagon in the driveway down to the river, where
he empties it from buckets into tubs.</p>
<p>Sometimes, he pulls out binoculars to better see the band number on a
bird, which he reports to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.</p>
<p>It's a lot of work, and he does it every day for as long as the swans
stay, usually from mid-November through February.</p>
<p>In February, parents start to drive away the 1-year-old cygnets, and the
3- and 4-year-olds start to select mates, whom they will keep for life.
That's when the amorous behaviors begin.</p>
<p>&quot;You can tell in various ways --- how they hold their necks, how they
hold themselves,&quot; Sheila Lawrence explained. &quot;They'll kick their
feet, and raise themselves out of the water.&quot;</p>
<p>It's a show that onlookers appreciate.</p>
<h3>Rebounding population</h3>
<p>Considering trumpeter swans weren't even seen in Minnesota between 1884
and 1966, when Hennepin Parks started to breed them in captivity, the
size of Monticello's swan population is astounding.</p>
<p>By 1930, trumpeter swans were thought to have vanished from the entire
United States. Then a few nests were found near hot springs in a remote
part of Yellowstone.</p>
<p>More nests were found in Alaska in the 1950s, and Minnesota was the
first state allowed to collect eggs from them, using funds contributed
by taxpayers via the &quot;chickadee check off.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1933, the entire country had only 50 breeding swans; now, Minnesota
alone has 17,000. Some winter along the Otter Tail River in western
Minnesota, and others in quiet pockets along the central and upper
Mississippi and St. Croix.</p>
<p>A few go to Oklahoma and Arkansas for the winter, but most stay in
Minnesota year-round.</p>
<p>Ideally, Minnesota's swans would resume previous migration patterns and
head south for the winter. But many of those who did were shot, and
others have found habitat near locks, dams and power plants that didn't
exist 200 years ago.</p>

<p>Before she retired, Sheila Lawrence had switched to nights at her job so
she could spend more time with the swans.</p>
<p>&quot;The trumpeters really captured my heart,&quot; she said. &quot;If you watch,
you realize what special birds they are. They're so majestic, so
graceful and beautiful; they're just beautiful birds. They're just
amazing.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: <a href="http://www.monticellocci.com/pages/swans">Swan-watching in Monticello</a></h3>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : It's about 40 minutes west of Minneapolis. From I-94,
take the first Monticello exit, which leads to County Road 75 (East
Broadway). At the first stoplight, turn right onto 39, drive a
quarter-mile and turn left onto Mississippi Drive.</p>
<p>Drive past the park and around the cul de sac, parking on the south side
of the road only. Observe posted signs and do not block residents'
driveways.</p>
<p><em>When to go</em> : Jim Lawrence feeds the birds at 10:30 a.m. every day from
mid-November through February, and it's fun to watch the swans flying
in. However, for quieter observation, you may want to visit earlier or
later.</p>
<p>Before traveling to Monticello, check the city <a href="http://monticellocci.com/pages/swans">swan
update</a> . On warmer days, the
swans may go into the fields to feed.</p>
<p>Swans also can be seen downstream, just inside the city limits at Battle
Rapids, where there's a clearing off County Road 39.</p>
<p>For details on planning a swan-watching getaway, see <a href="../../touring/interesting_towns/winter_weekend_in_monticello.html">Winter weekend in
Monticello</a>
.</p>
<p><em>What to wear</em> : Standing is a cold business, and the warmer you dress,
the longer you can watch. For tips, see <a href="../../outdoors_recreation/winter_play/warm_winter_clothes.html">Staying snug in
winter</a>
.</p>
<p><em>Taking children</em> [ : ]{style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;} Make sure they read
the 1970 classic &quot;Trumpet of the Swan&quot; by E.B. White, author of
&quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; and &quot;Stuart Little.&quot; It's about Louis, born without
a voice, and Sam, a boy who loves wild things.</p>
