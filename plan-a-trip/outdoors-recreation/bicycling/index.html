Starting from the south edge of Madison, the 40-mile trail plunges into Little Switzerland, taking bicyclists past a gantlet of cheese shops, meat markets, bakeries and breweries. But the Badger is best known for its 1,200-foot-long tunnel, cut through solid limestone in 1887.

Many trails skirt lakes and bogs, but since most are on old rail lines, fires sparked by passing trains created openings for prairie species, too.

Thanks to a network of abandoned electric railways, this part of northeast Illinois is a hotbed of bicycle trails. They're all popular, but the 40-mile Fox River Trail past St. Charles, Geneva and Batavia includes an astonishing amount of scenery and attractions: a Dutch windmill, Japanese gardens and a lighthouse plus many forest preserves, gazebos and wildlife sightings, mainly herons and egrets lurking on the shallow river.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-geneva-st-charles-illinois/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-glacial-drumlin-trail/">Riding the Glacial Drumlin</a></h2><p>In the middle of southern Wisconsin farmland, there’s a mystery that rivals those of the Mayans and Anasazi.

It's not so much the beauty of the lakes, though they're glorious. It's more the fact that ordinary folk can walk, bike, swim and play around them — all of them. It almost wasn't so.

In 1967, Wisconsin made a bicycling trail out of an abandoned rail bed that it had devoted to hikers until it saw that most of the users were on bicycles.
