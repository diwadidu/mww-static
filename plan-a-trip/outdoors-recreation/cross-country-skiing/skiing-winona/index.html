<h2>Snowstorms that blanket the southern woods bring skiers to Winona and nearby parks.</h2>

<p>Sometimes, skiers have a hard time figuring out Mother Nature.</p>
<p>It's supposed to snow across northern Minnesota and Wisconsin, but
often, storms have veered to the south instead. It's odd, but what can
you do? You have to go with the snow.</p>
<p>One year, at the end of February, my friend Becky and I were just about
to make the long drive to the snowy Upper Peninsula of Michigan when the
southeast Minnesota town of Winona got blanketed with 30 inches.</p>
<p>We'd heard about the trails at St. Mary's University, so we drove down
the Mississippi River to check it out.</p>
<p>First, we stopped to try <em>Frontenac State Park</em> , which has 10
kilometers of ski trails. Park manager Harry Roberts sold us a vehicle
permit and apologized for the drifted-in tracks.</p>
<p>&quot;After all those lean years, we had to give up our good groomer,&quot; he
said. &quot;Now we've just got a beat-up snowmobile.&quot;</p>
<p>But once we reached the forest, the tracks were fine. With flakes
swirling through the air, we skied through a corridor of sumac and up to
the blufftop.</p>
<p>From there, we could see the fuzzy gray outlines of the Mississippi and
the hazy white Wisconsin bluffs; the whole world seemed airbrushed.</p>
<p>After we checked into our B&amp;B in Winona, we had a quick burger at
Culver's and headed to nearby <em>Whitewater State Park</em> for its snowshoe
hike under a full moon.</p>
<p>&quot;We're just reveling in the snow,&quot; the naturalist told the large
group that assembled. &quot;And to think that on Tuesday, we're going to
tap a maple tree, and we'll have to literally plow our way into the
sugarbush.&quot;</p>
<p>Slipping into long-tailed Alaskan snowshoes, we followed him into a
wooded glen along the Whitewater River, where he tried to call in a
barred owl with the familiar &quot;Who cooks for you.&quot;</p>
<p>He didn't sound human to us, but if there was an owl, it wasn't
fooled. Looking up, we saw only the constellations and the gnarled
branches of oak, sharp against the night sky.</p>
<p>When we got up the next day, <em>Winona</em> was sparkling. Its white steeples
and domes pop out on a bright-blue winter day, and its ornate stone
buildings look even more elegant draped in snow.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="https://images.midwestweekends.com//media/images/w/i/winona_sledding_hill.jpg" alt="The sledding hill at St. Mary's University." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
St. Mary's sledding hill and cross-country ski trails are popular in
winter.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We found the campus of St. Mary's tucked into the foot of the bluffs on
the north edge of town.</p>
<p>From St. Yon's Hall, crisply laid tracks led us in long, narrow loops
up the valleys and along the wooded hillsides, so steep that at one
point, we saw the groomer had struggled to stay upright.</p>
<p>We wound around and came out at the top of an open hill, where an eagle
was circling above children pulling sleds.</p>
<p>From that vantage, the pale-yellow buildings of St. Mary's looked just
like a Tuscan hill town, framed by snow-capped bluffs, and when the
bells rang in its campanile, it sounded like one, too.</p>
<p>But the trail made Becky think more of the Superior Hiking Trail.</p>
<p>&quot;This is like a southern version of the North Shore, with these bluffs
and overviews,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Looping back, we saw a Pisten Bully chugging along, clinging to the side
of a hill. It looked like something a contour farmer would use to
cultivate his terraces in the Andes.</p>
<p>The groomer was Brother Jerome Rademacher, a retired St. Mary's physics
professor who used to build and sell tractors. He told us he did think
of himself as a farmer.</p>
<p>&quot;I like to run tractors,&quot; he said. &quot;It's kind of my hobby. I'm a
skier, and I've done the Birkie 10 or 12 times, but I'm big into
farming and tractors.&quot;</p>
<p>A Pisten Bully is the gold standard of groomers and costs $150,000 new,
but Brother Jerome got an old one for $20,000. The college almost sold
it, he said, but plentiful snow allowed the machine to earn its keep.</p>
<p>&quot;Because we're in the hills, we hold the snow a lot longer,&quot; he
said. &quot;If we get snow, we keep it.&quot;</p>
<p>Brother Jerome died in 2012, but the college still maintains his trails.</p>
<p>From St. Mary's, Becky and I went downtown for lunch in the 1897 former
Druid Hall, which now houses Bub's Brewing Co. It's the last remnant
of Bub's Sugar Loaf Brewery, which operated from 1856 to 1973 on the
side of Winona's famous landmark.</p>
<p>Today, it's a brewpub. I treated myself to a small glass of the house
amber and a bowl of bacon-Cheddar-potato soup, which was smooth and
rich; Becky's BLT had lots of meaty bacon.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="https://images.midwestweekends.com//media/images/w/i/winona_st_marys_skier.jpg" alt="Skiers head down the ravine at St. Mary's University in Wino" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>As we ate, we read about the brewery's presidents, most of whom rose to
the top by marrying the boss's daughter or widow, starting in 1872 with
Peter Bub (pronounced &quot;Boob,&quot; German-style).</p>
<p>Before heading down U.S. 14 toward Rochester, we stopped at Sugar Loaf
Antiques, in Peter Bub's old brewery on the bluff. More than 100
dealers were using the space, which includes three old caves dug into
stone, and last fall, the building's owner proposed building another
brewery there.</p>
<p>Seven miles east of Rochester, we stopped at <em>Chester Woods County Park</em>
, whose trails Brother Jerome helped plan. Following a little skier
sign, we made our way into the woods, where the snow cover was perfect,
except there was no track.</p>
<p>Then we saw groomer Kevin Crilly on a snowmobile, pulling an odd,
homemade tracker.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had a lot of unhappy customers,&quot; he admitted. &quot;I could have
started (grooming) at 9:30 if I'd had the snowmobile, but it was at the
other park.&quot;</p>
<p>But when the trails are groomed, he said, they get used.</p>
<p>&quot;We started grooming and everyone started flocking here,&quot; he said.
&quot;It just caught on.&quot;</p>
<p>The first tracks he laid were too soft for skiing, so we put on our
snowshoes and walked onto pretty Chester Lake, past some ice fishermen.
Crilly had said the ice was 14 inches deep, but near the shore, Becky
broke through and got wet up to her knee. The park was pretty enough,
but no St. Mary's.</p>
<p>Brother Jerome no longer grooms St. Mary's trails himself, but he's
still the one who makes sure it gets done. It isn't easy to produce the
pristine trails local skiers have come to expect.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been teaching people how to groom, because I have a touch of
Parkinson's,&quot; he says. &quot;I'll do it as long as I can.&quot;</p>
