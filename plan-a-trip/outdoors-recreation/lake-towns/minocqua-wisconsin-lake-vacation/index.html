<h2>In Wisconsin's north woods, vacationers flock to this Island City.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="https://images.midwestweekends.com//media/images/m/i/minocqua_skier_flags.jpg" alt="A water-ski line." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In northeast Wisconsin, Minocqua is all things to all tourists.</p>
<p>It's been a boating destination for more than a century because it's
on a chain of lakes and nearly surrounded by Lake Minocqua. In fact,
it's Nature's Original Water Park, and the town has the trademark to
prove it.</p>
<p>But summer is short, and these days, tourists like to keep busy. That's
why you'll also find water-ski shows, lumberjack shows, boat tours,
wildlife parks, bicycle trails, city-style shopping, golf and, in the
middle of downtown, mini-golf.</p>
<p>So much to do, so many places to go --- and yet the biggest crowds are
always outside the fudge shop.</p>
<p>Minocqua is just a little town of 4,400, but it has an outsized
reputation as a lake resort. Financiers and industrialists from Chicago
and St. Louis came up and built estates, which included the fanciful
boathouses for which the area now is famous.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Taylor vacationed on the lake for 10 years when she was a
teen-ager, staying at the estate of her great-uncle Howard Young.</p>
<p>Young, an art dealer and investor who endowed the local medical center,
also entertained Dwight Eisenhower before and during his presidency.
Eisenhower, like Taylor, loved to fish for muskies and bass.</p>
<p><a href="../../history_heritage/historic_houses/gangsters_wisconsin.html">Gangsters</a>
liked Minocqua, too. Al Capone went to Hayward, but his rival Roger
Touhy vacationed in Minocqua, fishing with a machine gun. It had
brothels and gambling dens; the Belle Isle, still a sports bar, had a
direct phone line to Arlington Park racetrack in Chicago.</p>
<p>The town is a favorite of vacationers from the Chicago area, though
people come from all over. When I was there one August, watching a
performance of the Min-Aqua Bats water-ski team, the announcer flushed
out visitors from California to Connecticut.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="https://images.midwestweekends.com//media/images/m/i/minocqua_downtown.jpg" alt="Downtown Minocqua." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
There's always a crowd in front of Minocqua Fudge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The Min-Aqua Bats are part of old Minocqua. Founded in 1950, the team
puts on the world's longest-running amateur water-ski show, and perhaps
the most popular -- it performs three evenings a week in the Aqua Bowl,
a short stroll from downtown.</p>
<p>Except for the isthmus that carries traffic to points north ---
adjoining Woodruff, then Boulder Junction, Manitowish Waters or <a href="../../history_heritage/american_indians/lac_du_flambeau_ojibwe_culture.html">Lac du
Flambeau</a>
--- Minocqua is an island.</p>
<p>It's not exactly an island of tranquility. Vacationers from resorts on
surrounding lakes -- one of the largest concentrations in the world --
flood in to eat, drink and shop in the businesses packed onto three
blocks of Oneida Street, also U.S. 51.</p>
<p>There's no stoplight, but somehow, traffic always comes to a stop when
a gaggle of tourists starts across the crosswalk.</p>
<p>A concrete bridge brings cars in from the south, and a high wooden
trestle bridge carries bicyclists out on the Bearskin State Trail.</p>
<p>Traffic underneath, on Lake Minocqua, is just as brisk. I joined the
pontoons and powerboats one Sunday to see the <a href="../paddling/boathouses_minocqua.html">historic
boathouses</a> by rented sea kayak.</p>
<p>The speeding boats kept me alert, that's for sure. But I got used to
them, like the loons and the bald eagles circling overhead, who seemed
unperturbed.</p>
<p>Most of the boathouses were built in the first three decades of the 20th
century, part of sprawling estates. Some are Craftsman-style or Queen
Anne; some look like little Swiss chalets, with window boxes full of
geraniums.</p>
<p>The 1908 boathouse of The Beacons, with its lighthouse-style tower, is
right across the lake from the Aqua Bowl. The condo resort itself is
new, however, like most of Minocqua.</p>
<p>There aren't many old-style resorts left, but the Coachlite is one of
them. Its cottages are on a rise overlooking the south shore, shaded by
white and red pines.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Started in 1920 as Warner's Circle Pines, it's busier than ever, says
Jane Teresinski, who owns one of the cottages and manages the resort
with her husband. But she's sad that the old lake culture seems to be
disappearing.</p>
<p>&quot;I've stayed at a lot of those new places, and it's like staying in a
hotel,&quot; she says. &quot;A lot of the people won't even swim in a lake;
they think a shark or something is going to gobble them.&quot;</p>
<p>The big new condo resorts are easy to spot around town, but the woods
still are full of small, traditional lake resorts. There are
campgrounds, too, some just a bike ride away from town, and one of
Wisconsin's most popular places to camp, Northern Highland American
Legion State Forest, is just 10 miles north.</p>
<p>Everyone can find something to love about Minocqua.</p>
<p>&quot;Once people come here, they always come back,&quot; Teresinski said.</p>
