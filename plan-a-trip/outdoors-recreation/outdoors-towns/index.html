Once, these lighthouse keepers, lumberjacks and lieutenants lived only in the history books. Now, they're painted onto Ashland's walls, where they serve as backdrop to shoppers, college students and tourists going about their business downtown. The first mural, painted for Wisconsin's sesquicentennial in 1998 by local artists Kelly Meredith and Susan Prentice Martinsen, featured the snowshoe-clad figure of pioneer Asaph Whittlesey as well as editor Sam Fifield, Ojibwe Chief Buffalo and other characters from the town's early days.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/ashland-wisconsin/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-outdoors-towns/">10 great outdoors towns</a></h2><p>best outdoors town tournament. It's hard to argue with Duluth, even against such better-known outdoors towns as Boulder, Colo., and Missoula, Mont., because everything it offers is right in the city – hiking, mountain biking, paddling, skiing.  But other towns are almost as deserving. Here are 10 great outdoor towns in the western Great Lakes.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-outdoors-towns/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/baileys-harbor-door-county/">Baileys Harbor in Door County</a></h2><p>Every May, wildflower followers find their way to Baileys Harbor. They walk past two 1870 range lights on a boardwalk lined by endangered dwarf lake iris.  On  strips of wetland called swales, they look for bogbean and goldthread. In June, they search for 25 species of orchids. The land Ridges Sanctuary occupies almost became a trailer park. Now, it's habitat for more species of plants than any other place in Wisconsin.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/baileys-harbor-door-county/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/bayfield-summer-wisconsin/">Beloved Bayfield</a></h2><p>On a summer day on Chequamegon Bay, there are few sights more enchanting than the sailboats bobbing around Bayfield.  Ferries chug nonstop between Bayfield and Madeline Island. Excursion boats head for the other Apostles. Sailboat captains take out novices and teach them how to hoist a jib.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/bayfield-summer-wisconsin/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-attractions-traverse-city/">The good life in Traverse City</a></h2><p>At first glance, Traverse City seems like just another Lake Michigan beach town. It's a truly gorgeous one, for sure. There's sand as far as the eye can see, wrapped around two vast bays. Everybody's playing beach volleyball, paddling kayaks or swimming in water tinted three shades of blue.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-attractions-traverse-city/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-ely-minnesota-summer/">Dreaming of Ely</a></h2><p>In Ely, one picture is worth a thousand tourists.

Indians and explorers always knew there was copper sitting along the Keweenaw Peninsula. But the desolation of the area made mining difficult. The earliest expedition, sent by London investors in 1771, gave up in disgust on an area Patrick Henry told Congress was &quot;beyond the most distant wilderness and remote as the moon.''</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/copper-harbor-michigan/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/">Four seasons of Grand Marais</a></h2><p>At the far tip of northern Minnesota, Grand Marais is a place that people love even more when the weather turns. When Lake Superior storms send giant waves crashing against the pier light, photographers rush to the harbor. Blizzards bring in skiers, and tourists flock to see ice floes and formations. This photogenic village at the foot of the Sawtooth range is a drama queen, a magnet for those who bask in the big lake's chill and revel in its 
unpredictability.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/fun-things-door-county/">10 splurges in Door County</a></h2><p></p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/fun-things-door-county/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/gunflint-trail/">Adventure on the Gunflint Trail</a></h2><p>In the 1920s, when the first resorts appeared along this remote, 57-mile highway that dead-ends near the Canadian border, guests had to have a certain sense of adventure. The Gunflint Trail first was blazed by the Ojibwe, then used by fur traders, trappers and loggers. It was still a zigzagging roller-coaster through the woods when vacationers began to come.  The first visitors in spring often had to patch the single phone line, which moose tended to snag and drag. Gasoline lanterns in their cabins often became plugged, and bears sometimes made appearances near cabins.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/gunflint-trail/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/madeline-island-wisconsin/">Madeline's magnetism</a></h2><p>Over the centuries, waves of history have buffeted Madeline Island and given it as many variations as a Lake Superior agate. This wooded island off Wisconsin's Bayfield Peninsula, the largest of
the 22 Apostle Islands, exerts a magnetic pull. The Ojibwe came from the east, led to &quot;food that grows on water'' — wild rice — by a cowrie shell in the sky, according to their origin mythology,</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/madeline-island-wisconsin/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/marquette-michigan/">Marquette's double appeal</a></h2><p>The first time I visited Marquette,  I saw mostly Yooper Land. I chuckled at a 10-foot mosquito, a giant chainsaw and packages of Roadkill Helper.  I noted the best-sellers in the bookstore window: &quot;A Look at Life From a Deer Stand'' and &quot;Leap of Faith 2: God Loves Packer Fans.'' This is the Marquette that's sports-crazy, hunting-happy and tough as nails, with a population descended from Cornish, Finnish and Italian immigrants who could put up with the rigors of iron mines and, later, their closings.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/marquette-michigan/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/outdoors-sports-galena/">Outdoors in Galena</a></h2><p>So you've done Galena — the shopping, the wine-tasting, the trolley tours, the historic houses. What now? This mining town in northwest Illinois boomed, went bust and came back as a boutique town for urban weekenders. Now, it's returning to nature.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/outdoors-sports-galena/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/stcroix-falls/">Trail mix in St. Croix Falls</a></h2><p>It's the western terminus of the 1,000-mile Ice Age National Scenic Trail, which traces the last glacier as it began to melt and retreat northward, leaving a marvelously lumpy patchwork of rock, rubble and river gorges.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/stcroix-falls/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/taylors-falls-minnesota/">Sightseeing on the St. Croix</a></h2><p>There’s only one place in the Midwest where potholes are a tourist attraction instead of a nuisance. Standing at the bottom of the 35-foot-deep Bake Oven, touching walls as smooth as vinyl, it’s easy to imagine the scene 10,000 years ago, when sheets of water from a melting glacier roared past Taylors Falls, into what now is the St. Croix River Valley.  They came with such fury that whirlpools laced with sand and gravel drilled cylindrical holes into solid rock — potholes, the world’s deepest.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/taylors-falls-minnesota/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/sturgeon-bay/">The door to Door County</a></h2><p>It would be natural, for a tourist, to arrive in Sturgeon Bay and just keep going. It would also be a mistake. The rest of Door County has all the tourist trappings. But Sturgeon Bay has appeal of its own. &quot;Most people want to go farther up on Door County, for all the shops and such,&quot; says Bill Munroe, a volunteer at the Door County Maritime Museum. &quot;But this is a working town. We like it down here. We like it very much.&quot;</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/sturgeon-bay/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/superior-wisconsin/">Duluth's twin in Wisconsin</a></h2><p>To most people, Superior, Wis., is nothing more than a series of traffic lights to endure on the fast track to the Apostle Islands or Upper Peninsula. It's sprawling, ugly and utterly devoid of interest. Or is it?</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/superior-wisconsin/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/thunder-bay-summer/">Exploring Thunder Bay</a></h2><p>To know Thunder Bay is to love Thunder Bay.  Lake Superior's largest town is hard to get to know, though, in part because it was two towns until 1970. No downtown pops out of the landscape; people driving through see only the flat sprawl of Fort William, then the hillier sprawl of Port Arthur.  But Thunder Bay's surroundings are spectacular: Mount McKay on the south, Kakabeka Falls to the west and Ouimet and Eagle canyons to the north.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/thunder-bay-summer/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/visiting-two-harbors-minnesota/">Discovering Two Harbors</a></h2><p>Most people know Two Harbors only by its spine, Minnesota 61, where a long gantlet of gas stations and fast-food joints tries to reel in tourists speeding up the North Shore.  Most tourists never see the massive ore docks, just a stone’s throw from a picturesque breakwall, boat launch and walking trail. Or the North Shore’s last working lighthouse, a 1892 brick beacon that glows flame-red in the afternoon sun.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/visiting-two-harbors-minnesota/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/trempealeau-trails/">Trails of Trempealeau</a></h2><p>All kinds of paths cross in the Wisconsin village of Trempealeau. Canoes and cormorants, tugboats and trains, bicyclists and blues fans all are drawn toward this Mississippi River town.  It’s just a little burg, but it’s smack in the middle of Mother Nature’s playground.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/trempealeau-trails/">Read story and trip tips</a></li></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="footer-links"><ul><li><a href="/plan-a-trip/">Plan A Trip</a></li><li><a href="/about/">Meet Us</a></li><li><a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="/events-policy/">Events Policy</a></li><!--li: a(href="/apps/contact.html") Contact us--><li><a href="/advertising/">Advertising</a></li></ul><p>&copy; Beth Gauper, 2007 - 2022 all rights reserved</p></div></div></div><div class="site-msg-container" id="web-compoment-msg"><div class="msg-outline"><p>Your browser does not support our events calendar page.
