It was a miracle that wouldn't last.  That's why it was torture for the dozen of us to sit through a long kayak safety course on the sandy beach of Bayfield, Wis., forming a ''human knot'' to foster cooperation in case of disaster and listening to trip leader Hovas Schall's horror stories about the big, mercurial lake.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/apostle-islands-kayaking/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/boathouses-minocqua/">Historic boathouses of Minocqua</a></h2><p>In Minocqua, you have to get in a boat to go on a historic home tour. In the first part of the 20th century, captains of industry streamed to this village in northeast Wisconsin, called the Island City because it is nearly surrounded by Lake Minocqua. Their estates are hidden in the trees, but the boathouses were built over water, fanciful structures with gables, balconies, towers and turrets.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/boathouses-minocqua/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/bois-brule-paddling/">Paddling the Bois Brule</a></h2><p>More than any other river in Wisconsin, the Bois Brule has a pedigree. They call it River of Presidents, but it also attracts senators and millionaires. Named for pines charred by lightning strikes — “burnt wood’’ in Ojibwe, then French — it rises from conifer bogs near Solon Springs and flows toward Lake Superior.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/bois-brule-paddling/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/canoeing-chicago-river/">Paddling the Chicago River</a></h2><p>The Chicago River never has run clear. Checaugou — for “swamp weed,’’ or “wild onion.’’ Then factories and slaughterhouses turned it into a sewer. At the confluence of the main branch with the north and south branches, Bubbly Creek was named for the methane gas that rose from decomposing carcasses on the river bottom.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/canoeing-chicago-river/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/boundary-waters-tips/">Minnesota's Boundary Waters</a></h2><p>Along Minnesota's northern border with Canada, more than 200,000 people a year find an increasingly rare commodity — absolute wilderness.  Today, the foot trails over which they carried canoes and 180-pound packs are used by vacationers, who wind their way from lake to lake in search of the perfect combination of woods, water and solitude.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/boundary-waters-tips/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/great-canoeing-rivers/">15 great rivers for paddling</a></h2><p>In this region, nearly every river is a good paddling river.  For scenery, head for the cliff-lined Upper Iowa, which National Geographic Adventure magazine calls one of America’s Best Adventure 100, along with rafting in the Grand Canyon.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/great-canoeing-rivers/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/float-ozarks/">Floating Missouri</a></h2><p>After a long, hard winter, the sight of blooming forsythia can be intoxicating. And a butterfly? That must be just a fleeting dream. My  daughter spotted those things plus a robin soon after we arrived in Missouri for spring break, and they were enough to make her giddy with excitement. &quot;Oh, I like this place,'' she cried. &quot;I like the way it looks, the warm spring air, the way it smells. And oh, look, some nice spring grass!''</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/float-ozarks/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/kayak-festivals/">Kayak klatch</a></h2><p>If you're interested in sea kayaking and ready
to jump in, kayaking festivals are a good place to improve skills and
meet other kayakers. Programs include classes, seminars, demos,
on-water tours and, often, races.  Sign up as early as possible for the best selection of classes and tours. Youths get discounts. Below are some of the best festivals.  Western Michigan Coastal Kayakers Association Symposium near Muskegon, Mich. This symposium on Big Blue Lake is held at YMCA Camp Pendaloun and offers an extensive schedule of courses and clinics for beginners and intermediate kayakers, including youths. Some kayaks are available to rent.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/kayak-festivals/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/guided-paddle-trips/">Along for the glide</a></h2><p>There's no better way to see nature's loveliest landscapes than on a river, the original highway. The same rivers that carried hunters, explorers and traders now carry us, the sightseers. Paddling along, we see the same things they did: otters, eagles, fish and deer, plus lovely flora and endless sky.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/guided-paddle-trips/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/kayaking-beginning/">Trying kayaking</a></h2><p>For a lot of people, canoeing is last year's sport. Kayaking is a step up,  like trading in the mini-van for a Miata. Who wouldn't want a zippy little kayak to pilot all by yourself, without that other person yelling at you from  the stern (or bow)? But a kayak with all the accessories is expensive. And it's hard to decide what kind of boat to buy, because you  need a different kind for different bodies of water — whitewater, lakes, rivers and inland seas, such as the Great Lakes.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/kayaking-beginning/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/kickapoo-river-canoeing-wisconsin/">Chasing the Kickapoo</a></h2><p>In southwest Wisconsin, following the Kickapoo River is a lot like watching a magic act: No matter how closely you pay attention, eventually what you see is going to disappear into thin air. When it reappears, it will be in a completely different spot, and you'll have no idea how it got there. &quot;Look, there it is again,&quot; said my husband, as we drove Wisconsin 131 through the Kickapoo Valley. &quot;It's meandering like mad.&quot;</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/kickapoo-river-canoeing-wisconsin/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/rossport-lighthouse/">Kayaking the Rossport Islands</a></h2><p>At the top of Lake Superior, there's a dramatic coast lined with rugged cliffs, cobblestone beaches and islands. It's the home of Parks Canada's Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area, created to protect the waters between the Sibley Peninsula, east of Thunder Bay, and the Slate Islands, off Terrace Bay. These waters are thick with islands, much like the Apostles in Wisconsin, except the islands are closer together. That makes them ideal for kayaking.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/rossport-lighthouse/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/kinnickinnic-kayaking-wisconsin/">A spin on the Kinni</a></h2><p>On Wisconsin's Kinnickinnic River, paddling is a lot like playing pinball — except your boat is the ball.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/kinnickinnic-kayaking-wisconsin/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/planning-canoe-kayak-trips/">Planning a paddle trip</a></h2><p>Outdoors and paddle clubs are happy to show the ropes to new members.  Outdoors stores offer boat demos and free classes on trip planning. Rangers at federal wildlife reserves offer guided trips.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/planning-canoe-kayak-trips/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/kayaking-st-louis-river/">On the water in West Duluth</a></h2><p>lot of water — beyond the big lake and the Aerial Lift Bridge.  Fishermen and bird-watchers have frequented it for years, and more are showing up as the water becomes cleaner. Sturgeon have come back, eagles nest, and 70 percent of the birds seen in Minnesota come through on fall and spring migrations.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/kayaking-st-louis-river/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/turtle-flambeau-mercer-wisconsin/">Tranquility in the Turtle-Flambeau</a></h2><p>In the northeast corner of Wisconsin, a vast, amoeba-shaped body of water spreads over 37,000 acres of state-owned land. Rivers run through it, the Turtle and the Flambeau. They were dammed to create a flowage in 1926, and today it's a state scenic waters area, designated for boating, fishing and camping. 
Hundreds of islands and secluded bays provide habitat for bald eagles, osprey and loons, who outnumber the paddlers who pull up to rustic campsites.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/turtle-flambeau-mercer-wisconsin/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/women-buying-kayaks/">Crazy about kayaks</a></h2><p>When some men reach a certain age, they get the urge to buy a zippy little sports car.

Sawmills were first to use the thundering rapids along the Wisconsin River, which have been working hard ever since. But these rapids generate more than the electricity that lights a bulb – they also draw world-class athletes for thrilling tournaments, such the 2012 world whitewater kayak/canoe championships for juniors and under-23 paddlers, some of them Olympics-bound.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/wausau-wisconsin-whitewater-paddling/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/wisconsin-river-sauk-city-arena-merrimac/">Road trip: Wisconsin River</a></h2><p>At Prairie du Sac, the Wisconsin River finally breaks free. Lined with so many dams and reservoirs it's often called the nation's hardest-working river, the Wisconsin devotes itself to play after it passes the town. Then it becomes the Lower Wisconsin State Riverway, beloved by canoeists, who like to play on its many sandbars.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/wisconsin-river-sauk-city-arena-merrimac/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/whitewater-kayaking-101/">Whitewater 101</a></h2><p>Whitewater paddlers are, by definition, thrill-seekers. That's why they seek out the northeast corner of Wisconsin, &quot;the cradle of rivers.'' The big Wisconsin River starts there, as do the Wolf, Peshtigo and Menominee, three of the Upper Midwest's best-known whitewater rivers. On the Wolf River, Bear Paw Outdoor Adventure Resort has been a whitewater hub since 1994, selling gear to expert wranglers and teaching novices how to handle the rapids that churn over knots of boulders dropped by the last glacier.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/whitewater-kayaking-101/">Read story and trip tips</a></li></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="footer-links"><ul><li><a href="/plan-a-trip/">Plan A Trip</a></li><li><a href="/about/">Meet Us</a></li><li><a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="/events-policy/">Events Policy</a></li><!--li: a(href="/apps/contact.html") Contact us--><li><a href="/advertising/">Advertising</a></li></ul><p>&copy; Beth Gauper, 2007 - 2022 all rights reserved</p></div></div></div><div class="site-msg-container" id="web-compoment-msg"><div class="msg-outline"><p>Your browser does not support our events calendar page.
