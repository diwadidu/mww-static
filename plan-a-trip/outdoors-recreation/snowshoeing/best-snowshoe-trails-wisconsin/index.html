The Birkebeiner trail near Hayward is a snowshoeing superhighway.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On the week before Christmas, I figured I'd found the prettiest place in
the world.</p>
<p>Fresh snow had fallen around Hayward, and the forest was sparkling. We
made our way down the intimate lanes of the Makwa Trail on snowshoes,
brushing past heavily laden balsam boughs as we scaled gentle ridges and
descended into snowy glades.</p>
<p>Each new tableau was more beautiful than the last, and I congratulated
myself on the discovery that single-track mountain-biking trails are
great for snowshoeing.</p>
<p>Then one of those boughs snapped into my face, and I wrenched my neck
whipping it away. We had to cut the hike short so I could get some
heavy-duty muscle relaxants from the local clinic, but I'll always
remember it.</p>
<p>On snowshoes, I've had the most fun bushwhacking on new snow. The first
time, it was in Nicolet National Forest, and a friend and I set off from
Bear Paw Outdoor Adventure Resort wearing rounded bear paw snowshoes.</p>
<p>That part of Wisconsin is too remote to have many trails, so we made our
own as we wove through old-growth pines to the Wolf River, gurgling
under a sheath of ice. It was the only sound and we were the only
people; we thought we were in heaven.</p>
<p>Most people want trails, but the best are the ones you make yourselves,
and they can be anywhere.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't encourage people to use trails because we want them to
strike off on their own,&quot; says Brenda Rederer, manager of Chippewa
Moraine Ice Age State Recreation Area, which supplies snowshoes to
visitors. &quot;Why snowshoe on trails then; why not just walk it?&quot;</p>
<p>It's all good when there's snow. Many chapters of the Ice Age Trail
Alliance sponsor snowshoe hikes; check its
<a href="http://www.iceagetrail.org/calendar">calendar</a> for dates.</p>
<p>Here are some of the best places to go in Wisconsin .</p>
<p>For lighted hikes, see <a href="../cross_country_skiing/candlelight_skiing.html">Ski or snowshoe by
candlelight</a> .</p>
<p>Before going, check the Wisconsin <a href="http://www.travelwisconsin.com/snow_report.aspx">snow-conditions
report</a> .</p>

<h3>Northwest</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.cambatrails.org/">CAMBA trails</a> [ between Hayward and Cable
]{style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;} . This network of mountain-biking trails
includes more than 300 miles of marked and mapped routes in six clusters
around the towns of Hayward, Seeley, Cable, Drummond, Delta and
Namakagon.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="https://images.midwestweekends.com//media/images/b/e/bearpaw_snowshoers.jpg" alt="Snowshoers walk through the snowy forest near Bear Paw Outdo" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Guests at Bear Paw Outdoor Adventure Resort snowshoe through Nicolet

<p>For intimate lanes and rolling hills, seek out the more difficult single
track. The Makwa Trail is close to Hayward and very scenic. To reach the
trailhead, drive six miles east of Hayward on Wisconsin 77 to Mosquito
Brook Road and head north.</p>
<p>Pick up maps and rent snowshoes at <a href="http://www.newmoonski.com/">New
Moon</a> , on U.S. 63 just north of Hayward.
Reserve in advance for weekends, 800-754-8685.</p>
<p>There's plenty of room to snowshoe on the broad Birkebeiner ski trail,
which the CAMBA trails cut across, but it's not as fun.</p>
