It’s slower than skiing, but you can go wherever you want, on footwear that doesn't need to be waxed and on trails that don’t need to be groomed. A lot of people will be getting or giving snowshoes as holiday presents. Many people automatically head for the high-tech metal shoes that are ubiquitous in sporting goods stores, but it’s worth considering other kinds.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/buying-making-snowshoes/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/best-snowshoe-trails-minnesota/">Snowshoeing in Minnesota</a></h2><p>There are many good reasons to go off trail, and the chance to see moose definitely is one of them.  But then the ranger mentioned she'd seen moose tracks
in fresh snow near the park entrance, and we decided to go
moose-tracking. Strapping on our snowshoes, we plunged from the road
into deep woods.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/best-snowshoe-trails-minnesota/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/black-river-michigan/">Waterfalls of the Black River</a></h2><p>On the western tip of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the Black River is only one of more than 200 rivers that feed Lake Superior. It punches far above its weight, however, in providing waterfalls: Five of them in one short stretch draw visitors year-round. Part of the million-acre Ottawa National Forest, the Black River is so scenic it's part of two national trails — the North Country Trail for hiking and the Black River National Forest Scenic Byway for driving.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/black-river-michigan/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/best-snowshoe-trails-wisconsin/">Snowshoeing in Wisconsin</a></h2><p>On the week before Christmas, I figured I’d found the prettiest place in the world.  Each new tableau was more beautiful than the last, and I congratulated myself on the discovery that single-track mountain-biking trails are great for snowshoeing.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/best-snowshoe-trails-wisconsin/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/great-snowshoe-trails-midwest/">Great places to snowshoe</a></h2><p>Everyone likes to snowshoe. It's cheap, easy and you can do it anywhere.  In winter, snowshoes are the bridge into the wild white yonder. They allow you get off the
beaten path and to places that otherwise would be hard to explore —
islands, overgrown woods, bogs and marshes. In deep snow, the first person to break trail has to expend some serious effort. If you're the fourth or fifth person on the trail,
though, that's just about right.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/great-snowshoe-trails-midwest/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/minnehaha-creek-snowshoe/">Snowshoeing on Minnehaha Creek</a></h2><p>If you’re a paddler, you’re done for the winter. But when one door closes, another opens. I’ve been meaning to paddle Minnehaha Creek through the heart of Minneapolis for years, but the water won't  stand still — sometimes it's  too high, sometimes too low. This 22-mile creek, named for a romantic character in an 1855 hit poem, connects everything that makes Minneapolis famous: the Mississippi River, Minnehaha Falls, the Chain of Lakes, Lake Minnetonka.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/minnehaha-creek-snowshoe/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-north-shore/">North Shore by snowshoe</a></h2><p>In summer and fall, hikers by the thousands take to the hiking trails on Minnesota's North Shore.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-north-shore/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-rivers-north-shore/">Snowshoeing river canyons of the North Shore</a></h2><p>On Minnesota's North Shore, winter opens new avenues for explorers. Miles of hiking trails already follow the gorges of rivers that flow into Lake Superior. But why hike the trails when you can hike on the river itself? A frozen river takes you straight into the scenery  — the slot canyons of the Onion, the steep red cliffs of the Devil Track, the waterfalls of the Baptism.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-rivers-north-shore/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-skiing-porcupines-michigan/">White gold in the Porkies</a></h2><p>On the far end of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park always rewards those who make the effort to get there. When 12 of us did, steering through a blizzard in cars heaped with snowshoes and skis, our prize was even more snow — falling every day from the sky, swirling in stiff winds and piled high on the earth.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-skiing-porcupines-michigan/">Read story and trip tips</a></li></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="footer-links"><ul><li><a href="/plan-a-trip/">Plan A Trip</a></li><li><a href="/about/">Meet Us</a></li><li><a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="/events-policy/">Events Policy</a></li><!--li: a(href="/apps/contact.html") Contact us--><li><a href="/advertising/">Advertising</a></li></ul><p>&copy; Beth Gauper, 2007 - 2022 all rights reserved</p></div></div></div><div class="site-msg-container" id="web-compoment-msg"><div class="msg-outline"><p>Your browser does not support our events calendar page.
