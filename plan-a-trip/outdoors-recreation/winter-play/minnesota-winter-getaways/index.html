<p>Skiers glide along the South Branch of the Root River on the
Harmony-Preston Valley State Trail near Lanesboro.</p>
<p>Before Valentine's Day, and as winter drags on, everyone starts thinking
about romantic getaways.</p>
<p>Well, we already have a story about <a href="../../stay/bed_breakfast/romantic_getaways.html">romantic places to
stay</a>
, and beyond
that, who can say what romance is?</p>
<p>Especially since &quot;romantic&quot; often is code for &quot;expensive.&quot; We think
romance has very little relationship to expenditure; we've found it in
tents and <a href="../../stay/camping/camper_cabins_midwest.html">camper cabins</a>
as well as luxurious inns. It's everywhere, if you look for it.</p>
<p>Here are 10 great Minnesota getaways for everyone, whether you're with
your sweetie, your kids, your pals or just yourself.</p>
<p>For budget travel, see <a href="../../best_trips/cheap_trips/cheap_winter_trips.html">Cheap winter
getaways</a> . For
next-door getaways, see <a href="wisconsin_winter_getaways.html">Near escapes in
Wisconsin</a> .</p>
<p><a href="../../regions/north_shore/index.html">North Shore</a> . This is hallowed
ground year-round for Minnesotans, a breath of fresh air along the shore
of a vast inland sea.</p>
<p>The craggy shoreline and river gorges are even more fun to explore when
they're draped in ice, and there's great skiing at Lutsen Mountains and
on cross-country trails in the forests and state parks.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many <a href="../../stay/classic_cabins/north_shore_lodgings.html">cabins, cottages and
lodges</a> , many with
inviting wood-burning fireplaces and views of the big lake.</p>
<p><a href="../cross_country_skiing/gunflint_trail_March.html">Gunflint Trail</a> .
This is where you go when you really want to be around a lot of
reliable, long-lasting snow; we like it best in March, when the days are
longer and sunnier and people in the cities think winter is over.</p>
<p>There are many great lodges along this 57-mile road into wilderness, and
they'll arrange all kinds of fun activities for their guests, including
horse-drawn sleigh rides, dog-sledding and snowshoeing into the BWCA.</p>
<p><a href="../../shopping_eating/shopping_towns/holidazzle_parade_minneapolis.html">Minneapolis</a>
. One word: skyways. They link nearly 80 blocks downtown, so you can
book a hotel and scurry from your room to great restaurants, shops and
theaters without putting on a coat.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="https://images.midwestweekends.com//media/images/s/t/st_paul_rice_park.jpg" alt="The Landmark Center in St. Paul." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In downtown St. Paul, the Landmark Center hosts many free concerts and
events.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Stay at Le Meridien Chambers and you'll be a stone's throw from the
grand Hennepin Avenue theaters. Or just get the best winter hotel rate
you can find and walk there by skyway.</p>
<p><a href="../../arts_culture/city_weekends/st_paul_sightseeing.html">St. Paul</a> .
The capital city has skyways, too. In the heart of downtown, see the St.
Paul Chamber Orchestra or Minnesota Opera at the Ordway Center or a
concert or hockey game at neighboring Xcel Energy Center.</p>
<p>On Rice Park, the Landmark Center holds many free concerts and family
events.</p>
<p>The Fitzgerald Theater, which hosts many folk concerts, is on the north
end of downtown. The Minnesota History Center, State Capitol, Cathedral
of St. Paul and James J. Hill House are on the hills around downtown.</p>
<p>Treat yourself with a night at The St. Paul, overlooking Rice Park . . .
then economize with a fun meal at Mickey's Diner.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../www.midwestweekends.com/plan_a_trip/regions/st_croix_valley/historic_stillwater_minnesota.html"><strong>Stillwater</strong></a>
. In the off season -- that's winter -- the deals are really good in the
many shops of this boutique village on the St. Croix River. After
shopping, stop at one of the many wine bars and restaurants, and stay at
one of two new boutique hotels.</p>
<p><a href="../../stay/bed_breakfast/lanesboro_BBs.html">Lanesboro</a> . This little
hamlet in bluff country is best known for bicycling on the Root River
State Trail, and it's pretty quiet in winter.</p>
<p>But the trail is groomed for cross-country skiing. One of the most
scenic stretches is west of town, from Isinours to Preston on the
<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/blufflands/harmony_preston.html">Harmony-Preston Valley State
Trail</a>
. It's flat, perfect for beginners and expert skiers alike.</p>
<p>There's also nightlife at the Commonweal theater, art to see and buy at
the Lanesboro Arts Center, dinners at the Old Village Hall restaurant
and the occasional barn dance.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../www.midwestweekends.com/plan_a_trip/outdoors_recreation/lake_towns/bemidji_bunyan_minnesota.html">Bemidji</a>
. This far-north town is the home of the original giant Bunyan and Babe,
who inspired a thousand roadside mascots.</p>
<p>It's a university town, so there's a lot of live music, at the college
and downtown at the historic Chief Theatre and Brigid's Cross Irish
pub.</p>
<p>But it's also wild about winter sports, so it's the place to place to
see curling (the city regularly contributes members of the U.S. Olympic
team) and speed-skating.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="https://images.midwestweekends.com//media/images/g/u/gunflint_lake_skiers.jpg" alt="Skiers climb a hill above Gunflint Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the Gunflint Trail, skiers climb a hill above Gunflint Lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There's alpine skiing, tubing and horse-drawn sleigh rides at at Buena
Vista Ski Area, cross-country skiing at Three Island County Park, Movil
Maze and Hobson Memorial Forest and snowshoeing at Lake Bemidji State
Park.</p>
<p>Stay at lakeside hotels near downtown or, farther up the lake, at
Ruttger's Birchmont Lodge.</p>
<p><a href="../../history_heritage/frontier_history/northfield_shopping.html">Northfield</a>
. This little college town just south of the Twin Cities makes a fun day
trip, though there are a couple of good places to stay, too.</p>
<p>Shop in the many one-of-a-kind shops along Division Street and stop by
the Northfield Historical Society Museum to learn how the townsfolk
dealt with the James-Younger Gang when they tried to rob the bank.</p>
<p>In the evening, go to one of the world class --- and free --- concerts
at St. Olaf College. For snowshoeing, head down the street to Carlton's
Arboretum along the Cannon River or to Nerstrand Big Woods State Park.</p>
<p><a href="../../touring/mississippi_river/red_wing_antiques.html">Red Wing</a> .
This town on the Mississippi River is the hub for three excellent <a href="../../arts_culture/theater_music/Mississippi_concerts.html">music
venues</a> ,
the Sheldon Theatre, Stoney End Music Loft and, in the bluffs above Lake
City, the Oak Center General Store.</p>
<p>On one weekend, you could catch two concerts, and sometimes three.</p>
<p>There's also shopping downtown and at Pottery Place, and plenty of good
places to stay and eat. Colvill Park, on the south edge of town, is a
good place to watch for bald eagles.</p>
<p><a href="itasca_skiing.html">Itasca State Park</a> . This park is wonderful in
summer and fall, but it's also crowded. Have it to yourself when snow
drapes the old-growth white pines, the headwaters and miles of trails.</p>
<p>Try to catch one of two lantern-lit ski and concert evenings, and stay
at the Itasca Suites next to Douglas Lodge.</p>
