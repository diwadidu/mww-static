In northern Michigan, cherries love the gravelly soil of the Old Mission Peninsula -and so do tourists. Door Peninsula, also warmed by the waters of Lake Michigan and known for cherries and vineyards.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/old-mission-peninsula-michigan-spring/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/best-trips/cheap-trips/cheap-summer-trips-michigan/">Cheap summer getaways in Michigan</a></h2><h3>On the Upper Peninsula and Lake Michigan shores, vacation for as little as $100.</h3><p>With shoreline on three Great Lakes, Michigan is a popular destination in summer. But it's still one of the best places to go for a budget beach vacation, thanks to the state parks. They offer a huge array of cabins and lodges as well as campsites, though you have to reserve far in advance for a place in Lower Michigan parks.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/best-trips/cheap-trips/cheap-summer-trips-michigan/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/best-photographers-upper-peninsula-wisconsin/">Following the photographers: Lake Superior's south shore</a></h2><h3>Wish you were there? For people who love the Upper Peninsula and Wisconsin northwoods, online images are the next best thing.</h3><p>If they're lucky, they get weeks of northern lights. Then, perhaps an irruption of snowy owls swept down from the Arctic. And if it's cold and calm enough, the mainland ice caves of the Apostles not only will be accessible but magnificently frozen by subzero temperatures. Amid so much natural beauty, photographers are like kids in a candy store. And they share their booty on Facebook pages and online galleries.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/best-photographers-upper-peninsula-wisconsin/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/mackinaw-city-colonial-michilimackinac/">Destination: Mackinaw City</a></h2><h3>On the south shore of the Straits of Mackinac, the year is 1775.</h3><p>At the top of the Michigan mitten, a little village has seen a lot of action over the centuries.  Then the continent's longest suspension bridge went up, a link to the Upper Peninsula and an attraction in itself.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/mackinaw-city-colonial-michilimackinac/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/tall-ships-festivals/">Following the tall ships</a></h2><h3>Sloops and schooners still sail on Lake Michigan and Lake Superior.</h3><p>On the Great Lakes, everyone loves to see a multi-masted schooner, white sails flapping in the breeze.  On Lake Michigan, these magnificent replicas of 19th-century schooners and sloops are more common, offering tours and day sails from their homes when they're not appearing at festivals.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/tall-ships-festivals/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/lighthouses/lighthouse-festivals/">Cruising to a lighthouse</a></h2><h3>In summer, excursion boats give visitors a chance to see historic beacons.</h3><p>By definition, lighthouses aren't easy to visit. Most are between a rock and a hard place, out of the way and on the edge of a fickle inland sea. “When the government came here after 1843, they were afraid the Native Americans would be hostile, but they quickly found out the only thing hostile was Lake Superior,'' said our captain on a cruise to the Copper Harbor Lighthouse in Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/lighthouses/lighthouse-festivals/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/lighthouses/lighthouse-stays-lake-superior/">Dwelling in the past</a></h2><h3>Around Lake Superior, overnight guests can try out life at a lighthouse.</h3><p>When Lake Superior lighthouses had keepers, there was nothing romantic about life there. The posts were cold, lonely and meagerly furnished on the government dime. The work was physically taxing and repetitive. Through the long nights, keepers had to get up every two hours to wind the mechanism that rotated the lens. It's no wonder many of the early lighthouse keepers were hermits or grouches.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/lighthouses/lighthouse-stays-lake-superior/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/national-parks-wilderness/isle-royale-national-park/">Exploring Isle Royale</a></h2><h3>Famous for its moose and wolves, this Lake Superior wilderness island is beguiling.</h3><p>When it rains on Isle Royale, you just have to soak it up. Moisture comes with the territory in Lake Superior's northern reaches. No one comes here for the weather, despite early advertising that called it a "Summertime 'Bermuda' Paradise." Bermuda it's not. But paradise? It depends on how you look at it.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/national-parks-wilderness/isle-royale-national-park/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/national-parks-wilderness/michigan-pictured-rocks-national-lakeshore/">Michigan's Pictured Rocks</a></h2><h3>There&#39;s a lot of scenery crammed into one stretch of Lake Superior in Michigan&#39;s Upper Peninsula.</h3><p>Along Michigan's Pictured Rocks, there's no such thing as a bad view. White sandstone cliffs line nearly 40 miles of national lakeshore, the nation's first when it was created in 1966. Named for the colorful swishes and whorls painted by mineral-laden water oozing through cracks, Pictured Rocks draws tourists from around the world.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/national-parks-wilderness/michigan-pictured-rocks-national-lakeshore/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/porcupines-wilderness-park/">Afoot in the Porkies</a></h2><h3>On the Upper Peninsula, a splendid wilderness remains unchanged in the Porkies.</h3><p>Just up north, there’s a vast wilderness of lakes, virgin forest and wild rivers lined by waterfalls and rapids. It isn’t like other north-woods forests - not as they are in this century, anyway. It’s a wilderness unto itself, and though it’s no farther than the state parks farther up Minnesota’s North Shore, it seems a world away. It feels a world away, too.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/porcupines-wilderness-park/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/waterfalls/tahquamenon-falls-michigan/">Tales of Tahquamenon</a></h2><h3>On Michigan&#39;s Upper Peninsula, a state park is a playground for waterfall-lovers.</h3><p>At most waterfalls, people mainly sit, look and take pictures.

One minute there was a dusting, and the next a whole layer, white and inviting. It seemed too perfect, as if there must be snowguns hidden behind the "Welcome to Michigan'' sign. But there was snow beyond that, too, right up to the doors of the three ski resorts that line U.S. 2 just inside the state line. That's why they call this Big Snow Country. Winds from the west whip across Lake Superior, picking up warmth and moisture, and dump it as snow - more than 17 feet annually, on average - when they hit the cold inland air of the U.P.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/alpine-ski-ironwood/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/spring-skiing-up-whitecap/">Cruising at Whitecap</a></h2><h3>In a far corner of Wisconsin, this ski resort has the woodsy charm of the mountains.</h3><p>Ah, the smell of Coppertone in spring. Leaning back on a chairlift, basking in sun bounced off acres of snow, I was getting quite a tan - on St. Patrick’s Day.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/spring-skiing-up-whitecap/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycle-trails-michigan/">Bicycling in western Michigan</a></h2><h3>In the top rail-trails state, everyone loves a ride along Lake Michigan.</h3><p>The more I travel through the beach towns of west Michigan, the more I want to see. So I've slowed down and started touring by the seat of my pants - on a bicycle. rail trails, more than any other state. You can catch a trail all along the Lake Michigan shore, from Traverse City to South Haven.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycle-trails-michigan/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/nordic-skiing-ironwood/">Ironwood the reliable</a></h2><h3>When most of the Upper Midwest is brown, cross-country skiers know where to find snow.</h3><p>In Ironwood, there’s one thing people can count on besides death and taxes.  Blown in over Lake Superior, the snow starts falling as soon as days cool down in late autumn and keeps falling until spring sun turns the pink-tinted piles into slush.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/nordic-skiing-ironwood/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-attractions-traverse-city/">The good life in Traverse City</a></h2><h3>On Lake Michigan, this beach town has a high IQ and refined appetites.</h3><p>At first glance, Traverse City seems like just another Lake Michigan beach town. It's a truly gorgeous one, for sure. There's sand as far as the eye can see, wrapped around two vast bays. Everybody's playing beach volleyball, paddling kayaks or swimming in water tinted three shades of blue.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-attractions-traverse-city/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/copper-harbor-michigan/">Copper Harbor refuge</a></h2><h3>Early fortune-seekers left their mark on a village at the tip of Michigan&#39;s Keweenaw Peninsula.</h3><p>Copper Harbor, Mich., never has had an easy existence. Indians and explorers always knew there was copper sitting along the Keweenaw Peninsula. But the desolation of the area made mining difficult. The earliest expedition, sent by London investors in 1771, gave up in disgust on an area Patrick Henry told Congress was "beyond the most distant wilderness and remote as the moon.''</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/copper-harbor-michigan/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/marquette-michigan/">Marquette's double appeal</a></h2><h3>With its shops, restaurants and prime spot on the lake, Marquette is both sophisticated and outdoorsy.</h3><p>The first time I visited Marquette,  I saw mostly Yooper Land. I chuckled at a 10-foot mosquito, a giant chainsaw and packages of Roadkill Helper.  I noted the best-sellers in the bookstore window: "A Look at Life From a Deer Stand'' and "Leap of Faith 2: God Loves Packer Fans.'' This is the Marquette that's sports-crazy, hunting-happy and tough as nails, with a population descended from Cornish, Finnish and Italian immigrants who could put up with the rigors of iron mines and, later, their closings.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/marquette-michigan/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/black-river-michigan/">Waterfalls of the Black River</a></h2><h3>Hike from waterfall to waterfall on the Black River to its mouth on Lake Superior.</h3><p>On the western tip of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the Black River is only one of more than 200 rivers that feed Lake Superior. It punches far above its weight, however, in providing waterfalls: Five of them in one short stretch draw visitors year-round. Part of the million-acre Ottawa National Forest, the Black River is so scenic it's part of two national trails - the North Country Trail for hiking and the Black River National Forest Scenic Byway for driving.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/black-river-michigan/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-skiing-porcupines-michigan/">White gold in the Porkies</a></h2><h3>In Michigan&#39;s Upper Peninsula, a wilderness park rewards those who love snow.</h3><p>On the far end of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park always rewards those who make the effort to get there. When 12 of us did, steering through a blizzard in cars heaped with snowshoes and skis, our prize was even more snow - falling every day from the sky, swirling in stiff winds and piled high on the earth.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-skiing-porcupines-michigan/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/michigan-state-park-cabins/">Michigan's great lake cabins</a></h2><h3>In the only state that borders three Great Lakes, the best places to stay are in state parks.</h3><p>On a summer day in Holland, Mich., all roads lead to the beach. When we were there one June, people streamed toward this broad swath of sand until the sun fell low on the horizon, making the fire-engine-red harbor beacon glow like an ember. They ate ice cream, they strolled on the breakwall, they took a last dip in Lake Michigan. But at 10 p.m. sharp, a police cruiser started flashing its red lights to shepherd everyone out of the park.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/michigan-state-park-cabins/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/best-sights-mackinac-island/">Touring Mackinac Island</a></h2><h3>From a scenic web of bicycle trails, visitors see another side of a celebrated vacation spot.</h3><p>In the straits between lakes Michigan and Huron, you can find more than one Mackinac Island. The best-known first was advertised as "the Fairy Isle of Mackinac," and it's not quite rooted in reality. It has a tuxedo shop but no hardware store, a Victorian house called Brigadoon and a fan club that gathers every October in vintage clothing to revere the year 1912. You get to that island in a horse-drawn surrey, driven by a liveryman in a top hat.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/best-sights-mackinac-island/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/lake-michigan-circle-tour-highlights/">Lake Michigan's greatest hits</a></h2><h3>Here&#39;s a nine-day itinerary that includes the best sights and attractions around Lake Michigan.</h3><p>It's America's freshwater Riviera, and everyone competes for a little piece of that beautiful sand: beach bums, lighthouse buffs, campers on a budget.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/lake-michigan-circle-tour-highlights/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/spring-scenery/spring-traverse-city/">Spring in Traverse City</a></h2><h3>Prowl through the locavore haunts of this Lake Michigan beach town.</h3><p>In Traverse City, spring is when you get to do all the things you planned in summer before you got seduced away by sand and surf. I'd seen the enticing shops, theaters and tasting rooms on other visits and planned to check them out “some time.''  Some time arrived Mother's Day weekend, when Traverse City was awash in color. So many pear trees were flowering downtown that the streets look frosted, and magnolia blooms were as big as popcorn balls.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/spring-scenery/spring-traverse-city/">Go to story ...</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="footer-links"><ul><li><a href="/plan-a-trip/">Plan A Trip</a></li><li><a href="/about/">Meet Us</a></li><li><a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="/events-policy/">Events Policy</a></li><!--li: a(href="/apps/contact.html") Contact us--><li><a href="/advertising/">Advertising</a></li></ul><p>&copy; Beth Gauper, 2007 - 2022 all rights reserved</p></div></div></div><div class="site-msg-container" id="web-compoment-msg"><div class="msg-outline"><p>Your browser does not support our events calendar page.
