My, how things have changed. In the United States, craft beer still claims only 11 percent of sales. But each year, more and more drinkers cross over from the lite side, and hundreds of new craft breweries spring up to serve them.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/beer-festivals-sampling/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/bockfest-new-ulm/">A German Mardi Gras</a></h2><p>Oh, the joy of being German. There's no question that Germans know how to have a good time. After all, they've given the world Oktoberfest, half-gallon steins and &quot;The Little Chicken Dance.''

Spotted Cow. Lazy Mutt. Uff-da. Uff-da? In Wisconsin, say that and you get a great glass of beer. Anywhere else you get . . . a funny look. Wisconsin may be full of cheeseheads. It may be a party state. But boy, are they drinking a lot of good beer there.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/beer-tour-wisconsin/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/brew-festivals-beer/">Best brew fests</a></h2><p>At last, Americans are realizing that life is too short to drink cheap beer. The tasteless factory lagers of our youth look awfully pathetic next to the beers now being turned out by craft brewers: sweet cream stouts, lip-smacking India pale ales, chocolatey porters, Belgian wheats flavored by coriander and orange. In fact, it's getting hard to keep up with all the new brews, some of them wildly creative. That's where brew festivals come in.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/brew-festivals-beer/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/breweries-twin-cities/">True brew in the Twin Cities</a></h2><p>It used to be that rebellious young men started garage bands. Now, they start garage breweries. Bud, Coors and Miller may rule the beer world, but craft brewers are its rock stars. At first, they made their own, getting supplies from St. Paul's Northern Brewer (&quot;good beer is your right''). Then, they started real breweries with names like Surly (&quot;the anger fueled by the inability to find good beers'') and Flat Earth (&quot;join the movement against the reign of watered-down domestics'').</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/breweries-twin-cities/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/fall-winery-festivals/">On the wine trail</a></h2><p>As fall winds down on forest trails, the season is just gearing up
on wine trails, where groups of wineries invite folks to take a little
drive, sample the wares and maybe take home a few bottles. Since
wineries tend to be in very scenic areas, that’s not such a bad idea.
And in late autumn, many offer special events to put buyers in the holiday
spirit. Here are the 2021 events on wine trails in Iowa, Minnesota,  Wisconsin and Michigan.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/fall-winery-festivals/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/grape-stomps/">Great grape stomps</a></h2><p>During harvest time in a vineyard, turning purple has nothing to do with the Minnesota Vikings.  Vineyards don't get their
juice that way anymore, but many still offer a grape stomp, and there's
nothing goofier to do on an autumn day.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/grape-stomps/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/milwaukee-brewery-tours/">Mad about brew</a></h2><p>For people who love beer, there’s no better place to drink it than in a brewery. In 1880s, beer-loving Milwaukee had more than 80 of them. Three became national giants, giving Milwaukee the nicknames Beer Town and Suds City, but only one survived. That’s Miller, acquired in 1969 by Philip Morris and now part of Molson Coors. Schlitz closed in 1981, and Pabst in 1997.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/milwaukee-brewery-tours/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/ice-bars-winter/">Chilling at an ice bar</a></h2><p></p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/ice-bars-winter/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/pub-brewery-crawls/">Hopping onto the ale trail</a></h2><p>These days, it seems as if all the world wants to go on a pub crawl.  West Loop and sometimes other  neighborhoods.

Vineyards
tend to be in very scenic areas, and wine trails allow buyers to
meander along pretty country roads, stopping here and there to quaff a
glass of wine or have a picnic. Of all the states, Michigan has been most active in forming winery trails. And why not? There have always been a lot of orchards in Michigan.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/wine-trails-midwest-wineries/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/wollersheim-winery-wisconsin-river/">A vintage vineyard</a></h2><p>In the wooded bluffs across the Wisconsin River from Prairie du Sac, the Saturday before Thanksgiving is a red-letter day for wine drinkers.
