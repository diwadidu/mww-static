Rotting carcasses made the Chicago River bubble; a glass of water came with a side of cholera. But the city grew up.

That's what the two dozen people on a house tour and progressive dinner in Dubuque, Iowa, kept saying as the tour progressed from one Victorian mansion to another.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/progressive-dinners-dubuque/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurants-brainerd-lakes/">Dining up north: Brainerd to Nisswa</a></h2><p>In summer, the crowds pour into the Brainerd Lakes, the Minnesota vacation land that's been stomping grounds for millionaires and middle managers alike since the loggers finished up  and headed west. What's it known for? Lakes, of course. And golf. It's not so known for its restaurants, but that may be because only locals know the best places.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurants-brainerd-lakes/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurant-weeks-midwest/">Time to feast</a></h2><p>There's only one good way to respond to cold: Take a cue from bears and pile on some fat. Oh, you could buy long underwear. But doesn't it really make more sense to gobble some blueberry cobbler with freshly whipped cream? The Restaurant Week season is starting, giving you another good —no, irresistible — excuse to eat: It's a deal!</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurant-weeks-midwest/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurants-decorah-iowa-harmony-minnesota/">Table-hopping in bluff country</a></h2><p>Sometimes, we like to travel like kings . . . and paupers, too. I suspect a lot of other people do the same thing. To get what we want, we save on something else. Our favorite splurge is eating out, but a meal for two in a really good restaurant costs $80-$100, same as a hotel room. Our solution? We pitch a tent.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurants-decorah-iowa-harmony-minnesota/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurants-brainerd-lakes-whitefish/">Dining up north: Pequot to Crosslake</a></h2><p>North of moneyed Gull Lake, the Brainerd Lakes area starts to look more like traditional Minnesota resort country.

 six weeks of sacrifice looming, Poles go on a paczki binge, eating as many
 of the fried, fruit-filled bismarcks as they can in the days up to Fat 
Tuesday, also known as Paczki Day. A round Polish version of a 
jelly doughnut, paczki (pronounced POANCH-kee) have fillings of raspberry, strawberry, lemon, custard, blueberry, apple, poppyseed and, most traditionally, prune, apricot and rose petal.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/paczki-bakeries-fat-tuesday/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurants-hackensack-longville-walker/">Dining up north: Longville to Walker</a></h2><p>In the middle of Minnesota's vacation land, the lakes go from big to bigger.

It’s on the road to nowhere, a mile and a half off the highway that links Park Rapids to Walker. It’s not on a lake. It has virtually no houses. It does, however, have a knack for hyperbole. In the 1920s, it tried &quot;land of clover, the big white potato and the dairy cow.’’</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurants-dorset-minnesota/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurant-tours-chicago/">Chow-down in Chicago</a></h2><p>Chicago has come a long way since it was hog butcher to the world. There was nothing very appetizing about early Chicago. The factories and slaughterhouses that made it grow also made it stink. Rotting carcasses made the Chicago River bubble; a glass of water came with a side of cholera. But the city grew up. The immigrants who packed its meat, dug its waterways and built its railroads moved on and were replaced by new immigrants, who settled in places that became known as Little Italy, Andersonville, Polish Village, Ukrainian Village, Chinatown, Greek Town and Pilsen.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurant-tours-chicago/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurants-wineries-amana-colonies/">Eating in the Amana Colonies</a></h2><p>Before 1932, the pious, hard-working people of the Amana Colonies were the only people in Iowa who got to eat out every night.  Butchers, brewers and winemakers turned out goods for everyone, and meals were served in 50 communal kitchens.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurants-wineries-amana-colonies/">Read story and trip tips</a></li></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="footer-links"><ul><li><a href="/plan-a-trip/">Plan A Trip</a></li><li><a href="/about/">Meet Us</a></li><li><a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="/events-policy/">Events Policy</a></li><!--li: a(href="/apps/contact.html") Contact us--><li><a href="/advertising/">Advertising</a></li></ul><p>&copy; Beth Gauper, 2007 - 2022 all rights reserved</p></div></div></div><div class="site-msg-container" id="web-compoment-msg"><div class="msg-outline"><p>Your browser does not support our events calendar page.
