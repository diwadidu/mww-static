<p>Walnut carpenter's lace. Fireplaces made of Italian mosaic tile. Yards

<p>Oooooohh.</p>
<p>That's what the two dozen people on a house tour and progressive dinner
in Dubuque, Iowa, kept saying as the tour progressed from one Victorian
mansion to another.</p>
<p>Despite its obvious appeal to the antiques crowd, the tour is more than
a cavalcade of architecture and ostentation. Along the way emerges a
social history of a frontier town in which an enterprising man could
grab opportunity and turn it into enormous wealth.</p>
<p>Dubuque is the grittier cousin of Galena, 16 miles south in Illinois.
Both sprang out of a lead-mining boom, but Galena, three miles distant
from the Mississippi, started shrinking before the Civil War. Dubuque
kept growing and producing --- lumber, meat, wagons, boats --- and
prospering, which explains the abundance and variety of Victorian
architecture.</p>
<p>French-Canadian fur trader Julien Dubuque was the first white man to
settle in the area; he traded lead mined by local Mesquakies until his
death in 1810. When the Mesquaki lost control of the area after the ugly
Black Hawk War of 1832, Missouri farmboy Mathias Ham set up shop and
pulled millions of dollars in lead ore from the earth.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It is at Ham's 1856 blufftop house, now a museum, that the progressive
dinner begins. My group settled around tables in the cellar for chicken
salad in puff pastry and fruit. Then we joined interpreter Rachael
Beasley, who started her commentary on upper-class social mores of the
time by showing us a whalebone waist cincher --- 18 inches, about the
circumference of a cantaloupe --- that girls were forced to wear
starting at age 6 or 7.</p>
<p>The keeping of appearances turned out to be a recurring theme in the
houses, which were built to impress business associates. Ham put a
cupola and an eight-pillar entrance on his limestone-block house, but it
didn't help his fortunes much --- they soon changed, and he was forced
to take in boarders.</p>
<p>Across town, at the Redstone Inn, we spooned up vegetable soup in the
warm glow of walnut and redwood, under crystal-teardrop chandeliers.
A.A. Cooper, the man who built the 1894 mansion, came to Dubuque in 1846
at age 17 to take a job as blacksmith's apprentice that paid $35 a
year.</p>
<p>Eventually, he started the Cooper Wagon and Buggy Co., whose covered
wagons were nicknamed Old Reliable and carried pioneers to Utah and
along the Oregon Trail. Cooper built the Redstone as a wedding gift for
his daughter; today, it's an inn.</p>
<p>The builder of the 1873 Ryan House earned his wealth the old-fashioned
way --- through connections. Meatpacker William &quot;Hog&quot; Ryan had an
influential friend from his Galena days, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, and the
result was contracts to supply the Union Army and frontier forts with
pork.</p>
<p>We ate London broil and tarragon chicken as we were regaled with a
history of the house and its strong-willed occupants over the years.</p>
<p>Then it was on to English trifle in the 1890 Stout House, a showcase of
the kind of carpenter's artistry a lumber baron can command. Frank
Stout made much of his fortune on Wisconsin's white pine but chose
Brazilian rosewood, sycamore, mahogany and blond oak from the
Philippines for this house.</p>
<p>From the Stout House, it was only two blocks to my room at the 1908
Mandolin Inn, yet another fabulous old mansion that gets its name from a
lovely leaded and painted-glass window portraying St. Cecilia, patron of
musicians. A formal four-course breakfast was served the next morning
with candlelight and soft concertos.</p>
<p>Then it was back to real life. The funny thing about Dubuque is, it
doesn't feel much like real life --- not modern days, anyway. In fact,
it's often used as a movie setting, filling in for Boston in &quot;Field
of Dreams.&quot;</p>
<p>Like the houses, the most picturesque tourist attraction in town is
rooted in the past. In 1882, a banker who lived atop the bluffs but
worked below got fed up with the long buggy ride around the bluff, which
ate into his noontime nap. So he built an incline railway, modeled after
those in the Alps, and had his gardener haul him up in a cable car each
noon. J.K. Graves' neighbors envied him and asked for rides; soon, the
railway was opened to the public.</p>
<p>Today, tourists love to creak up the 65 percent grade in the little
green-and-white car. Locals use it, too, to get to the Saturday farmers
market and the boutiques in Cable Car Square. The view of the river and
steepled cityscape from above is magnificent.</p>
<p>On the bluffs sit many more Victorians, painted ladies rather than the
red and brown stone mansions below. Banker Graves' frame house, with a
turret and curving porch, is among them on Fenelon Place.</p>
<p>Graves, Ham, Ryan, Cooper and Stout. They thought big and built big, and
their landmarks ensure they're not forgotten.</p>
