</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Everyone looks for something different in a B&amp;B. Some people just want
to relax in fancy environs, and their search is relatively easy: Look
for high-end inns and be willing to pay for them.</p>
<p>I'm always on the move when I stay at a B&amp;B, so I look for one that's
near whatever I plan to do - biking, hiking, touring. If the
proprietor is reasonably friendly and the room clean and comfortable,
I'm happy.</p>
<p>But I like inns best if they have a unique character and reflect their
surroundings. When we stayed at the Silver Star Inn in Spring Green,
Wis., one May, for example, the owner didn't lavish wine or chocolate
on us.</p>
<p>But the inn was filled with unusual art that reflected her interest in
photography and days as a Madison art dealer, and we went home with
dried morel mushrooms she and her family had gathered from the
surrounding hillsides.</p>
<p>Spring Green is a famous center of art and idiosyncrasy (House on the
Rock, Frank Lloyd Wright), so that was perfect.</p>
<p>Of course, it's also nice when an innkeeper does dote on a guest and
anticipate every need.</p>
<p>Everyone likes something different. Some seasoned travelers don't want
to know too much about an inn, because the surprise is what they like
best. If that's not you, here are a few guidelines to consider when
looking for a B&amp;B.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><em>1) Make sure the owner wants you to come</em> . A wise inn proprietor told
me this when I was new to travel writing, and I thought, 'Huh?' Now I
understand completely. Some owners get into the business more because
they love decorating, not because they love hosting.</p>
<p>If a proprietor doesn't sound happy to see you, don't make the
reservation.</p>
<p><em>2) Look for an inn whose proprietor has a professional attitude</em> . It
should belong to an inn association or, at least, be a member of the
local chamber or tourism bureau.</p>
<p>Today, an inn must have a web site, and it's a good sign if the owners
put their full names on it.</p>
<p>It's even better if the site includes information on local attractions
and events.</p>
<p>This means innkeepers are thinking about how they can enhance your
vacation - possibly because they're nice people, but also because
they want you to remember your trip (and their inn) fondly, tell all
your friends about it and thereby increase their business.</p>
<p>That's how it should be.</p>
<p>And when you call, make sure the phone is answered with the name of the
inn, not just &quot;Hello?&quot; If it isn't, don't reserve.</p>
<p><em>3) Be skeptical of inns that boast top ratings or mentions in
guidebooks or magazines</em> . The inns that offer the most free rooms to
guidebook and free-lance travel writers and buy the most advertising in
magazines generally are the ones most frequently mentioned in travel
stories.</p>
<p>Can these stories be trusted? Maybe, maybe not.</p>
<p>You won't find independent reviews at such directories as Lanierbb.com,
BBonline.com and Bedandbreakfast.com.</p>
<p>Inn owners pay for these listings, and generally, they're the ones who
write the material. However, these sites may list specials the inn is
offering.</p>
<p><em>4) Word of mouth is the best way to find a B&amp;B</em> . But friends don't
know everything, so you can look on-line for reviews. TripAdvisor has
the most, but its reviews should be taken with a grain of salt,
especially if there's only one or two about a property.</p>
<p>If it has 25, however, and nearly all of them are good, you can be
fairly confident. For more about using TripAdvisor, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/plan/more-info/word-of-mouse/">Word of
mouse</a>.</p>
<p><em>5) Look for an inn that has a point of view</em> . Good innkeepers know no
inn can be everything to everybody, so they play up what they can do
best. Some cater to bicyclists and some to hikers, and they should offer
such amenities as secure bicycle storage and, perhaps, shuttles.</p>
<p>I also like an inn with a democratic bent. For example, if an inn has
one inexpensive room, and a room accessible by disabled travelers, and a
room with two beds for friends traveling together, that says to me, &quot;We
welcome guests of all kinds.&quot; Those are the best inns.</p>
<h3>What to ask</h3>
<p>After you've selected an inn, don't hesitate to make sure it's what
you expect. Pictures don't lie, but they can mislead.</p>
<p>Many inns say their rooms have <em>fireplaces</em> , but that can mean several
things: wood-burning fireplace, gas fireplace, electric fireplace,
free-standing wood stove or gas stove. If you're counting on the
crackling of a wood fire in a hearth, be sure to ask.</p>
<p>Other inns say they have <em>whirlpools</em> . Usually, that's a whirlpool for
two, but it could be a regular bathtub with whirlpool jets. If that's
important to you, ask if two people can comfortably sit in the
whirlpool.</p>
<p>And unless you also want to bathe in the tub, make sure there's a
shower.</p>
<p>The days of shared <em>baths</em> are almost over. But some rooms still have
&quot;private&quot; baths that are across the hall, down the hall or even in
another part of the house. If you want a private bath in your room, ask.</p>
<p>That said, you usually can get a great deal at a B&amp;B with shared baths
if you come midweek, when it's unlikely you'll have to share the
bath.</p>
<p>Once you're staying at an inn, remember to be a good guest. Innkeepers
are there to serve you, but not wait on you hand and foot. This is their
home, so be sure to respect it and them.</p>
