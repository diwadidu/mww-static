Fans of sand and sun love Lake Michigan, which is lined by state and city parks with gorgeous stretches of sand and dunes. You can’t buy a better beach vacation at any price, but you have to plan ahead. Planning is tricky because you pass through four states, 30 state parks and two big metropolitan areas, each of which floods beaches with hordes of sun-worshippers on weekends.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/camping-lake-michigan/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/camping-midwest-state-parks/">Camping in state parks</a></h2><p>So this year, you got a great campsite in your favorite state park. Or maybe you didn't.  The people who get them know how to work the angles. Mainly, that means knowing when to reserve.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/camping-midwest-state-parks/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/camping-minneapolis-suburbs/">Camping in the Twin Cities</a></h2><p>Not all of the beach camping in the Upper Midwest is in a state park or even in the countryside.  They’re a great deal for visitors and also for locals who want to save gas money and travel time.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/camping-minneapolis-suburbs/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/camping-trip-packing-list/">What to bring on a camping trip</a></h2><p>Tent camping is the best deal in travel. You can go at the last minute, you get the most scenic locations and you pay a pittance.  It's too bad about all that stuff you have to bring along.  Some super-organized people love to pack gear and have most of it ready to go after the last camping trip. But most of us aren't that kind of person.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/camping-trip-packing-list/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/camping-west-twin-cities/">Camping in Kandiyohi</a></h2><p>In Kandiyohi County, it's thanks to the last Ice Age that life's a beach today. Near Willmar, a lobe of the last glacier came to a grinding halt 12,000 years ago, dumping massive blocks of ice that made big dents in the ground. Now, they're lakes, popping up like mirages at the edge of soybean fields, behind screens of ash and cottonwoods. Farther north, they're hidden amid rocky meadows and rolling hillocks full of glacial rubble.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/camping-west-twin-cities/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/camping-without-mosquitoes/">Getting away from mosquitoes</a></h2><p>Had it with mosquitoes? Head for southeast Minnesota. That's
karst country, where porous limestone lies just under the surface and
rain sinks into fast-moving underground streams that are chilled to 48
degrees when they run through the many cave systems.  Trout like it, but
mosquitoes don't. There's no standing water, so there's nowhere for
them to breed.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/camping-without-mosquitoes/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/easy-camping-state-parks/">Camping without roughing it</a></h2><p>Even if you camp, you don't have to rough it.  A lot of state parks have plenty of woods, water and wildlife, but they're also just a short bike ride or walk away from the finer things in life — say, a pizza parlor or ice-cream stand.  Nearby restaurants make packing easy because you can leave the pots, dishes, soap and firewood home. Even if you like cooking over a fire, it's still nice to go out for a treat.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/easy-camping-state-parks/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/yurts-minnesota-michigan-iowa/">A yen for yurts</a></h2><p>Yurts have popped up all over the Midwest, from Michigan to Iowa and now, to Minnesota state parks. Seven new yurts have joined 88 camper cabins in Minnesota parks and recreation areas. Two are in Afton State Park on the St. Croix River, near St. Paul. Two are at Glendalough State Park in west-central lakes country, near Battle Lake. And three are in Cuyuna Country State Recreation Area, the mountain-biking destination between Brainerd and Mille Lacs.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/yurts-minnesota-michigan-iowa/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/yurts-state-parks/">A yurt on an Iowa lake</a></h2><p>One June, I was a very lazy camper.  I threw a sleeping bag and pillow into the car and drove two hours down Interstate 35 to Clear Lake, Iowa. I didn’t bother to solicit company; in early June, most people where I live want to go north, not south.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/yurts-state-parks/">Read story and trip tips</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/great-campsites-midwest/">30 great campsites</a></h2><p>There's nothing like finding the perfect campsite. I look for them wherever I go, and when I was at Northern Highland-American Legion State Forest, one of the most popular campgrounds in Wisconsin, I found it: Campsite 435. It's framed but not enclosed by trees, has a lovely view of Crystal Lake and is on the edge of its sand beach. It's near the shower house and not too close to latrines, easy to reach but not heavily trafficked and off a paved bicycle trail to nearby towns.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/great-campsites-midwest/">Read story and trip tips</a></li></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="footer-links"><ul><li><a href="/plan-a-trip/">Plan A Trip</a></li><li><a href="/about/">Meet Us</a></li><li><a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="/events-policy/">Events Policy</a></li><!--li: a(href="/apps/contact.html") Contact us--><li><a href="/advertising/">Advertising</a></li></ul><p>&copy; Beth Gauper, 2007 - 2022 all rights reserved</p></div></div></div><div class="site-msg-container" id="web-compoment-msg"><div class="msg-outline"><p>Your browser does not support our events calendar page.
