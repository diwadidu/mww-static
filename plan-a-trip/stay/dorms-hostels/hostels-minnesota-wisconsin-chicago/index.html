<h2>Feeling adventurous? The dorm-style lodgings are open to everyone, and you can't beat the price.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="https://midwestweekends.com/media/images/h/i/hi_2ndfloorarea.jpg" alt="Hostelling International in Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; HI Chicago</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Hostelling International hostel in Chicago's South Loop includes a
spacious commons area.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>To get a bargain on lodgings, you can try Priceline or Hotwire. You can
clip coupons or use AAA or AARP discounts.</p>
<p>You can try every angle, but a single traveler still won't find a bed
that's cheaper than those at hostels.</p>
<p>Many Americans think hostels are used only by college-age backpackers in
Europe. That's how most of us discover them.</p>
<p>My first stay, at a hostel in the heart of London, was memorable: I made
friends with two other college kids, and we celebrated my 19th birthday
by going out for fish and chips and then to the theater. As we walked
home, Prince Phillip and the Queen Mother drove by.</p>
<p>I still stay at hostels once in a while. On a June hiking trip in the
Swiss Alps, my husband and I stayed in one in Grindelwald. And on a July
trip to Madison, Wis., I stayed at one two blocks from Capitol Square.</p>
<p>I wasn't the only geezer there, either. At breakfast in Madison, I met
Mike and Shelley Buonaiuto, sculptors who had driven up from
Fayetteville, Ark., to exhibit at the popular Art on the Square fair. I
asked if they often stay at hostels when they travel to art fairs.</p>
<p>&quot;No, but I wish we did,&quot; Shelley said. &quot;It's so much nicer than a
hotel.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;It's vital; there are other travelers,&quot; Mike said. &quot;Last night, I
talked with this guy who lives half the year in Crete, and he really got
me jazzed about going there.&quot;</p>
<p>For four nights in a private room, the Buonaiutos paid $217, not that
much less than they would have at a suburban franchise hotel reserved
through Priceline, which the couple sometimes use.</p>
<p>But they much preferred the old brick house with a fire escape on the
alley and a Costa Rican café in the basement.</p>
<p>&quot;Hotels are so sterile, they're like death,&quot; Mike Buonaiuto said.</p>
<p>Of course, many people do stay at hostels because they're cheap. At the
Madison hostel, I also met Charlie, a college student from England who
had hoped to save even more money by <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.com/">couch
surfing</a> but had no references and had
been turned down by potential hosts.</p>
<p>He'd narrowly missed sleeping on a park bench that night because his bus
was two hours late and he barely made check-in at the hostel.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="https://midwestweekends.com/media/images/m/a/madison_hostel.jpg" alt="The hostel in Madison." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Hostelling International Madison hostel has an excellent location
between Capitol Square and Lake Monona.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Hostel manager Michelle Vidovic said guests tend to fall into four
categories: college students from other countries; visitors to the
university; participants in clinical studies at the nearby Covance
facility; and a few domestic travelers on road trips, mainly from
Chicago or the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>Lately, there's been a new kind of guest, she said: people passing
through looking for jobs. When I checked in at 7:30 p.m., I got the last
bed in the female dorm.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, that's so unusual for a Thursday,&quot; she said. &quot;Last night we were
busy, too.&quot;</p>
<p>I got the Frida Kahlo upper bunk, which was in a room for six. Women's
beds are named after ground-breaking women, and men's beds after
endangered species.</p>
<p>There are common rooms, too, with WiFi and a DVD library for guests. At
the computer, Charlie was trying to figure out how to get to Winnipeg by
bus; when he was finished, I checked my e-mail.</p>
<p>Outside, salsa music was playing at Café Costa Rica, and I sat at a
sidewalk table and ordered a mojito and mango-tilapia salad. At another
table, three women were laughing uproariously over margaritas.</p>
<p>I walked toward Capitol Square, inhaling the town's trademark fragrance
of curry, ratatouille and patchouli, past sidewalk tables filled with
people celebrating a summer evening in Madison.</p>
<p>Under the blue-and-white awning of the Come Back Inn, a crowd was
drinking cheap beer, and I saw that a 1967 VW camper van had nabbed the
best spot in the parking lot.</p>
<p>Ah, Madison. If you weren't lucky enough to go to college there, spend a
few nights in a dorm room at the hostel and pretend you did.</p>
<p>When I climbed into my bunk at 11 p.m., two of the beds still were
empty, and I worried that their occupants would stumble in drunk in the
early hours.</p>
<p>But with ear plugs and an eye mask, I didn't hear a thing until I woke
up at 7:50 and went to feed the meter. All of my roommates were young,
and they slept until 9 a.m. and even closer to the 10 a.m. check-out.</p>

<h3>A hostel in Chicago</h3>
<p>It's not necessarily young folk who make boisterous roommates, anyway.
When I toured the hostel in Chicago's South Loop, I chatted with Kate
Monahan of New Jersey, who was winding up a four-night stay that had
been peaceful until the previous night, she said, when an older woman
wouldn't stop talking.</p>
<p>Monahan had recently retired from Princeton University and used a gift
of 100,000 frequent flier miles to come to Chicago for a taping of the
radio show &quot;Wait Wait, Don't Tell Me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I got four nights here for $120; you can't beat that,&quot; she said. &quot;I
couldn't afford a hotel. And you can fix food in the kitchen.&quot;</p>
<p>The Chicago hostel, which has been rated Best Large Hostel in the World
by travelers on Hostelworld.com, is posh compared with the Madison
hostel.</p>
<p>It has a carpeted great room with ping-pong, foosball and pool tables,
and an Internet room and library. It offers free hot cocoa, a pancake
happy hour and a breakfast of bagels, muffins, cereal, fruit, coffee,
tea and juice.</p>
<p>Local volunteers take guests on outings around town, and the hostel
arranges discounts at local attractions and sells transit passes.</p>
<p>There's a café in the building and a Panera down the street. Grant Park,
home of Chicago's huge free music festivals, is a three-block walk.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Hostel hospitality</h3>
<p>Other U.S. hostels are in lighthouses, dude ranches, ski chalets and old
mansions. Some have fireplaces, and a few have hot tubs or saunas.
There's an even greater variety in Europe; in Carcasonne, France, I
stayed in a castle.</p>
<p>Some are better than others. At their best, hostels are a lot like B&amp;Bs,
except cheaper. If their staffs didn't really like people, they
wouldn't be working there.</p>
<p>Vidovic loves the mix of people who show up at the Madison hostel. She
has worked in Ghana and once ran a former backpacker hostel in Malawi,
and she says she learned how to treat travelers from the warm
hospitality Africans showed her.</p>
<p>&quot;I like helping people feel grounded and oriented in a new place,&quot; she
said. &quot;I like making them feel at home.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Staying at a hostels</h3>
<p><em>What to know</em> : All ages are welcome in hostels. Some hostels have
curfews, but most don't. Guests are expected to clean up after
themselves. Some hostels (in Europe, nearly all) provide breakfast.</p>
<p><em>When to go</em> : Hostels are like any other lodgings - they book up in
advance for festivals and summer weekends. So call ahead; you can use a
credit card to reserve and also to pay.</p>
<p>Winter is quiet, and if you go on a weekday, you may have a room to
yourself. Most hostels have private rooms, and often they don't cost
that much more per person.</p>
<p><em>What to bring</em> : Each hostel is different, so ask questions when you
reserve. Most provide blankets and pillows. Some provide linens and
towels (guests are expected to strip their beds before leaving); if they
don't, most rent them for a small fee. Nearly all have fully equipped
kitchens for guests to use.</p>
<p>If you'll be sleeping in a room with other people, bring ear plugs and
an eye mask. If you want to read in bed, bring a reading light.</p>
<p><em>Cost:</em> The per-person rate structure favors the single traveler and
groups. For families, the cost can approach that of a basic motel room,
though access to a kitchen can mean big savings. <a href="http://www.hiusa.org/membership/ways_to_join">Membership in
Hostelling International</a>
reduces nightly costs. It costs $18 per year for adults and is free for
youths.</p>
<p><em>How to choose</em> : Read reviews at
<a href="http://www.hostelworld.com">Hostelworld.com</a> and
<a href="http://www.hostels.com/">Hostels.com</a> , but take them with a grain of
salt. These sites also include private hostels.</p>
<h3>Wisconsin</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.hiusa.org/madison">Hostelling International Madison</a>
hostel is at 141 S. Butler St., two blocks from Capitol Square, where
the famous Dane County Farmers Market is held Saturdays, and Lake
Monona, where guests can ride the Capital City State Trail, hear a free
concert at Monona Terrace or see a free water-ski show at Law Park on
Sunday evenings.</p>
<p>The house has 31 beds in smaller rooms, including five private rooms
that sleep two to five people in a mix of full and twin beds. It's not
air-conditioned, so rooms can get warm.</p>
<p>Linens and towels are provided. It's very environmentally sensitive; in
the bathrooms, there's a small bin of clean rags for guests to use
instead of paper towels, and a sign announces, &quot;Here at the Madison
hostel, every day is Earth Day.&quot;</p>
<p>Guests can check in until 9 p.m. Call 608-441-0144 to reserve.</p>
<p>In the winter, the hostel is quiet; many guests are foreign students who
stay for several months at a time. Hotel rates are very high on weekends
when University of Wisconsin football and basketball teams play home
games, so a stay at the hostel is a good alternative.</p>
<p>In southern Wisconsin, just off I-94 west of Milwaukee, the <a href="http://www.hiusa.org/eagle">Eagle Home
Hostel</a> is very well located, right in the
<a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/kms/">Kettle Moraine State Forest-Southern
Unit</a> , three miles west of
Eagle and Old World Wisconsin.</p>
<p>There's hiking and snowshoeing on the Ice Age National Scenic Trail,
which adjoins the property, and the Emma Carlin mountain-biking trail is
a mile away.</p>
<p>In state forest, there's excellent skiing. The <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/lapham/">Kettle Moraine State
Forest Lapham Peak Unit</a> has
17 miles of trails, three of them lighted daily, and the <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/kms/">Southern
Unit</a> has more miles on the
Nordic, McMiller and Scuppernong trails.</p>
<p>The 1890s brick farmhouse has three bedrooms with eight beds. Guests can
use the large living room, dining room and kitchen. To make a
reservation, call manager Bill Livick at 262-495-8794, or 262-442-6360,
eaglehostel@gmail.com.</p>
<p>Just north of Milwaukee, <a href="http://www.wellspringinc.org/">Wellspring</a>
retreat center and organic farm in Newburg, near Riveredge Nature
Center, also is a member of Hostelling International. 262-675-6755.</p>
<h3>Chicago</h3>
<p>The Hostelling International
<a href="http://www.hichicago.org/">J. Ira and Nicki Harris Family Hostel</a> in
the South Loop, at Congress and Wabash three blocks from the Art
Institute, is quite posh, with pancake happy hours, an Internet room and
a carpeted great room with foosball, ping-pong and a pool table.
Volunteers takes guests on forays around town.</p>
<p>Area residents (who have zip codes that begin with 606) are not allowed
to stay unless with a group of 10 or more that has reserved in advance.</p>
<p>The rate includes a breakfast of bagels, muffins, cereal and fruit, and
there's a kitchen where guests can cook for themselves. There's also a
cafe in the building. Reserve in advance for the big summer festivals in
Grant Park. 312-360-0300.</p>

<h3>Everywhere else</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.hihostels.com/">Hostelling International</a> has more than
4,000 hostels in 80 countries.</p>
<p>In the United States, <a href="http://www.hiusa.org/">Hostelling International
USA</a> has nearly 70 hostels. Both organizations
are non-profits.</p>
